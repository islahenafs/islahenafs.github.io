                        <p>What does freedom mean? Someone said it rightly. “Does the eagle want to swim in the sea? Is it being restricted by the sky? Does the fish want to dance in the wind? Isn't there enough water in the sea to explore? Yet, the sky means freedom for the bird, but death for the fish. The sea is wide enough for the fish, but will engulf the bird. We ask for freedom but freedom to do what? We can only express our nature as it was created. The prayer mat of the earth is freedom, freedom from slavery for some, but not for others. Who offers a shoreless ocean of love to swim in and horizon that extends to the next life? Yet, we chose the prison and call it freedom.” </p>
