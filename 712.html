                        <p>However, one should be mindful of these blessings and remember that this world is a place for tests and tribulations. We have to counter many different situations and circumstances. Many of them would be very unpleasant which would serve as a lesson for our overall improvement. We may run into these circumstances due to our negligence or outcome of any of our prior act. They may be a tool to remind us about Allah and Aakhirah or they may be to break our false pride. These difficulties can be of many kinds. However, disillusion and confusion can be heart breaking. Every mankind has to undergo this. Satan also play devious to mislead us. Once upon a time some people said uncharacteristic things about the pious lady like Hazrat Ayesha (RA). This resulted in grave hurt to our Prophet (PBUH). May Allah save us from disillusion and unpleasantness the way He saved Hazrat Ayesha (RA) by revealing Surah Baraâ€™at (Ameen). There is certain wisdom behind every unpleasant or difficult situation which we do not understand. Its only when they get over then we can realize the learning of those circumstances. </p>
