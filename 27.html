                        <p>We must recite Darood Shareef in abundance, because there are two important benefits to it: Firstly, Allah will send His Mercy and Blessings (Barakah) upon us. Secondly, our love and relationship with Prophet (PBUH) will be stronger. In every situation, we must remain focused towards Allah, as He is the only One Who can solve all our problems. We should keep in mind that the world is a Paradise for non-believers anda prison for believers. </p>
