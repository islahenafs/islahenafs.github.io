                        <p>Allah Ta‘ala is Most Merciful and Benevolent and by these virtues He gives many opportunities to sinners to rectify themselves and mend their ways through repentance. Allah Ta’ala puts the sinners through hardships and problems so that they realize their mistakes and return to the righteous path. But if the person is adamant and remains sinful, then he might face severe punishments from Allah Ta’ala. When one faces hardships and problems, one should ask himself if he has harmed anyone, even unintentionally, or has he done something wrong to someone. At times, it is quite difficult to understand or realize this. </p>
