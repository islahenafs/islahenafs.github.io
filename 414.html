                        <p>If we investigate the qualities passed by the Prophet PBUH within someone else it will cause misunderstanding. We Muslims must remember that we are the Ummah of a Prophet PBUH who was extremely good mannered. Therefore, we should also adopt good manner and behavior. For that matter we have to read Urdu literature. Learn yourself and let your children learn. This will create mannerism. My request is not to let the ego be within our heart and betrayed by our body as this will cause failure. You are the Ummah of the person (Prophet PBUH) from whom the flowers beg for their fragrance. </p>
