                        <p>His conduct towards others was consistently humble and gentle. In particular, he never liked to create problems for his Companions, explaining everything to them slowly and clearly, so that they should never become confused as to the true meanings of the divine revelations which formed the bedrock of his divine prophetic mission. And if he avoided exaggeration, he also avoided excessive brevity. Even in everyday matters, he would take care not to disturb them in any way. For example, if he had to go outside late at night, he would be careful to make no noise putting on his shoes or in opening and closing doors, so that no one should lose their sleep. This absence of pride was also apparent in his home, where he did not shirk domestic chores, working methodically and doing everything with his own hands. The Prophet PBUH said “ He who loves my Sunnah has loved me, and he who loves me will be with me in Paradise.” Someone said, “Never ignore a person who loves you, cares for you, and misses you because one day you might wake up and realize, you lost the moon while counting the stars”. </p>
