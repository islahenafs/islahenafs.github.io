                        <p>One thing he could never condone was cruelty and he kept his distance from those who were callous in their behaviour to others. He himself never mistreated anyone, never even slapped an erring slave or servant, and certainly never hit a woman. He could not bring himself even to beat an animal. He refrained from finding fault with things and people, showing forgiveness even to those who treated him badly -even if it meant suffering losses or damage to property. As Hazrat Anas explained, “I served the Prophet for ten years, but whatever I did during that long period, he never asked me why I had done this or why I had done that.” There was not the least trace of vengefulness in his nature; he never used to lose his temper with people in personal and domestic matters, and never stooped to the use of coarse language. His treatment of relatives, friends and neighbours was exemplary. But nothing would contain his anger if he felt that disrespect was being shown to the Sharia. Then he would either point out to the detractors the error of their ways, or he would just depart. Often he would simply turn his face away, so as not to display his displeasure. Whatever he chose to do, it befitted the gravity of the situation. He himself went in fear of the The Almighty, and treated every small boon as a great blessing from The Almighty. Never did he disparage any of Allah's bounty to man. All of his life was spent in remembrance of his Creator— “whether sitting or standing”. He performed the obligatory prayer so sedulously that his feet would become swollen, and during the recitation of the Quran, he would weep out of love and fear of his Maker. His reverence for Allah was such that he always spoke quietly and never in excess of what the situation warranted. He was outspoken in his abhorrence of falsehood, and not even a thoughtless word ever passed his own lips. Self-praise was also something which he disapproved of and he did not even like the Companions praising each other. </p>
