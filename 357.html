                        <p>It is advisable to the in laws that you must shower love, kindness and be forgetful and forgiving towards the bride's short comings and instead highlight her good qualities and praise her in matters - big or small. We forget she has left everything for your family and that your son is reaping the comforts provided. At the same time, it is also advisable that the newlywed bride show great obedience, respect and offer her services (khidmah) to the groom's family to the best of her ability. Insha-Allah by doing so Allah will return her good deeds with great rewards such comfort, peace, love and respect towards each other. This will protect both from the net of Satan. </p>
