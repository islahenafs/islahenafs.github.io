                        <p>On Death of Imaan. Hazrat Maulana Yusuf Sahib RA used to say, " Oh Haji sahib and Namaazi sahib, spend time in the path of Allah to achieve concrete Imaan, Imaan achieved only at home will be wiped out during the time of death.‚Äù I often think death is a very painful affair, because most of the people die with severe ailments which in itself are so painful. Feeling extreme thirst, the grief to leave the materialistic world and relatives, then traveling towards an unknown destination - the life after death. Satan will also come with a powerful influence of vasvasa and thoughts to weaken and Imaan and Intellect, during all these sufferings and nightmares, is it not easy to die with Kalima (Imaan), in fact, I would say it's very tough. But those who have prayed throughout their life to die on Imaan and led a life according to Sunnah and Sharia, certainly Allah will not dishearten them. He will reward them with the gift of Imaan, I cannot say more than that, it is Allah's own Mercy and Decision to decide who will die on Imaan and who will not. What I can say is that those who are careless and remain ignorant of Khatma Bil Khair might suffer the dire consequences of dying without Imaan. May Allah protect us! So don't be ignorant but be concerned and ask for it throughout your life. </p>
