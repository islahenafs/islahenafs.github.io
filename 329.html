                        <p>What are the diseases and cures of Nafs? </p><p>Allah has made the human body weaker compared to many of his creations. Many a times a person remains unwell. He may be tired but his Nafs keep him egging on and force him to complete his worldly desires. He may not be physically strong enough due to illness or tiredness to bear the outcomes of the fulfillment of his desires but his Nafs keep him pressurized to fulfill his desires. If a person follows his Nafs blindly then he would fall sick. It has been observed many a times that a person may not be able to digest food any further but he gets carried away and end up overeating. This results in acidity, indigestion and possibly other discomforts. </p><p>The cure of Nafs is that a person dislikes what he was fond of earlier. E.g. a person was fond of music, movies etc. but once he got an initiation in the spirituality his spirit drives him away from these things. However, this can happen only when a person has got divine intervention and he has overcome his worldly desires. Once he gets a taste of spirituality, his belief gets strengthened. He starts disliking what he was fond of earlier. This is called the cure of Nafs. However, this cannot be attained without the hard yards in the field of belief and the pursuit of truth. </p>
