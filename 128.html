                        <p>All should strive to save themselves in Aakhirah. Nobody can safeguard anyone. Once the Prophet (PBUH) also told his daughter to strive to do good deeds to save herself from the wrath of fire from Hell. The Prophet (PBUH) advised her that she only could do this to save herself. When the Prophet (PBUH) could suggest this to his own daughter then what to talk of Ummah. </p>
