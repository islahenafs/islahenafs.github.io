                        <p>Whoever resolves his matters with Allah, He creates benefits and enables that person to lead an easy life. The person is able to garner the support of others. Whoever has mercy upon the creations (makhloogq) of the earth will enjoy the mercy of the Heaven. We must treat our staff and servants well as they take care of our family members and us. </p>
