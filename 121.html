                        <p>It has been observed that men cannot survive without permitted desires and pleasures. But they often cross the limit and indulge in prohibited acts to attain pleasure and thereby commit sin. Hence such men reach the gates of destruction. The Islamic laws and Sharia is formatted in such a way that one must succeed in life and Hereafter by adhering to the laws and principles of Sharia. </p>
