                        <p>Often, in married life Satan gets into the mind of one of the partner and makes him pinpoint the negative aspects of the other person's character. This causes friction between them and the rift between the two widens with time. Instead the partners should see the strengths and good points of each other and prosper together. By only seeing negatives and finding faults in a person, one may not analyse a situation correctly which can cause negative impact in a relationship. Once I joked with my wife by saying, “All the men would have landed in Paradise if there weren't any women in this world”, she replied, “The very existence of men would not have been in this planet without us (women).” A relationship made out of fear of Allah does not need promises, terms and conditions- it just needs two wonderful people.” </p>
