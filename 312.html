                        <p>It is not right to just sit and keep praying and hoping that Allah would turn things around. Allah says in his Holy book that Allah helps those who help themselves. You need to act and take right decisions and actions at the right time. One had to be bold and be confident. Allah has bestowed this characteristic in many people who always display patience and march ahead with courage. </p>
