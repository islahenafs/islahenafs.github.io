                        <p>The Holy Quran is our manual and Prophet Hazrat Muhammad (PBUH) is our instructor who has explained through his traditions (Sunnah) as how a Muslim should led his life by the Holy book (Quran). His companions who abided by that were successful as Allah was pleased with them and they were pleased with Allah. </p>
