                        <p>One should keep a close watch on climatic changes and illnesses, which happen due to change of weather. One should not ignore even a small illness and nip it in the bud before it becomes a bigger issue due to negligence. In a nutshell, prevention is always better than cure. Those who suffer from high blood pressure and blood sugar but do not think that they fall in the category of being termed a sick person, will suffer dire consequences because of ignorance. They do not monitor their BP and sugar regularly because they think they are normal. </p>
