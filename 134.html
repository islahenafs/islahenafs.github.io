                        <p>The Nafs of some people are so spoilt that they seem highly incorrigible. Sometimes to cure the spoilt soul Allah gives us a displeased condition. Some people do not obey anyone because they become slaves of their own Nafs (Mind). For such people, you should not ruin your mind and bother unnecessarily. Just let them be as they are. </p>
