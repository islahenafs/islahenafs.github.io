                        <p>Why are our children getting wayward?</p><p>It is observed these days that people do not spend time to bring up their children properly. First of all they themselves are not religious or are aware of the nitty gritty of their religion. They do not even try to pay attention or inculcate these Islamic habits among themselves or among their children. If both of them are working then the children are brought up by grandparents or maids/servants of the houses. When both the parents are busy in work or chatting on mobiles with their friends then how would they bring up their children in a desired manner. Parents should leave other things aside and pay attention to their children. If a person goes out with Jamaâ€˜at then it is his responsibility to ensure that his home environment is also religious. It is observed that a person befriends new people and is always busy chatting with them. If he is always busy like this then how would be bring up his children. </p>
