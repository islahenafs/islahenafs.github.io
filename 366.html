                        <p>It is often notices that people call Maulvi for the recitation of Quran or hang a amulet (taveez) in their shops whenever their business is not doing well. I would advise them to analyse themselves whether they are fair in their transactions. Are they fair in their weights and measurements? Are they fair with their words and actions? Are they trading with all truthfulness? Are they not breaking any promise? Check whether they are hurting their customers or employees unintentionally or knowingly. If they overcome these deficiencies then they would not have any issues as Allah has promised rewards for good deeds. </p>
