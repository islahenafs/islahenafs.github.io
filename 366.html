                        <p>I have penned a few things for my own reformation and to explain others though I was not very keen to write the same. E.g. Some Aaeemma recite Quranic verses during Qayam in Salah very melodiously and properly but are not careful in fulfilling other aspects like Rukoo or sujood and carry out them in haste. Is it right? Salah is offered for Allah and every aspect should be paid attention. It is not proper to recite Quranic verses during qayam with a thought that the rest of the people would be pleased with their melody. This intention is not proper. </p>
