                        <p>Intolerance and arrogance amongst people is in vogue these days, as times change, so it is better not to advise them much, but you can advise your loved ones such as your wife, children relatives and employees. Heart doesn't accept harsh words, it only accepts soft and kinds advice that is why often people do not love a dictator You must address those matters to Allah when you cannot tell to the people. </p>
