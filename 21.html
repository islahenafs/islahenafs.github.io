                        <p>It has been narrated that famous Tabiyee Hazrat Owais Qarni RA, was so dedicated to his ailing mothersâ€™ service, due to which he could not become a Sahabah. Despite that he held an exalted status in the eyes of Allaah. Prophet SAW instructed Hazrat Umar RA and one more Sahabah to visit Hazrat Owais Qarni and and ask him to make Dua (Supplication) for them. Does it not dawn upon us the importance of Khidmah towards our parents? Through this you can attain the highest level of spirituality. </p>
