                        <p>those institution are the responsibility of the community as these people serve their lives for the upliftment of community only. We should be generous in helping them and should give gifts and do financial help of these institutions so that they can carry our their work without worrying about the economics. It is not right to save wealth in banks and be miser in helping others. If you serve these people wholeheartedly then you would get rewarded doubly in Aakhirah. This would help us a great deal while our accounts would be evaluated during the day of judgment. Moreover if we would not help our own community then who would do the same? </p>
