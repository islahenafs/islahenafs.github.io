                        <p>People who assume that what they are saying is right, are only fooling themselves. I want to narrate an anecdote here: One day in office, my manager walked up to me and mentioned Mr. Arif is here to see you. I thought it's my friend Arif and walked out to meet him. When I stepped out, I found that the print-job guy Arif was there. Wasn't I deluded? Can't we all be wrong, despite being so sure that we are right. “Alie doesn't become truth, wrong doesn't become right & evil doesn't become good, just because it's accepted by a majority”. </p>
