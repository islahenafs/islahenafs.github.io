                        <p>When the Satan fails to entrap somebody in sins he involves him in enormous thoughts. By destroying his mental peace it traps him into depression. In order to avoid these situations the person must search happiness and contentment in permissive acts. He must give up the cause of his problems and anxieties and Insha-Allah peace will be with him. </p>
