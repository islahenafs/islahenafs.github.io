                        <p>Intellect resides in the heart. It's an Arabic proverb, “If the heart is at peace the mind too will be at peace.” Allah has designed the spiritual heart in such a way that it's only meant to be obedient towards the Quran and Sunnah. So, fill it with fear of Allah, the work of Dawaah, remembrance of death, perform good deeds for the Hereafter, surround yourself with Noor of faith, exemplary deeds and attitude, forgive others faults, practice silence, moderation, shedding tears for repentance, enrich yourself with Wisdom, be good-natured, practice humility and good mannerisms. The heart is at peace when it sheds tears in front of Allah because of the sins one has committed. Focusing on Allah means being humble, so consider it and change your attitude. The heart is pleased to live in an atmosphere like the one at a mosque and in the company of pious people. It is important to have Prophetic manners and etiquettes. One must be less interested in the materialistic world. When the heart imbibes these qualities, it remains at peace. But what is happening today is that we are keeping our heart devoid of feelings, commit sins, haram, unhealthy desires, apprehension and lavish living. And that is the reason why we are all the time under stress and feel frustrated. All the problems surrounding mankind today are the result of a damaged spiritual heart. </p>
