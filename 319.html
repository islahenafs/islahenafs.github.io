                        <p>I want to draw your attention on two very important things: good deeds, and actions. Everything is useless if you do not do right deeds. When our Prophet (peace be upon him) was going for Meraaj with archangel Gabriel then he (peace be upon him) saw certain things going up and something coming down. He (peace be upon him) asked Gabriel what they were. He replied, 'the ones going up are the deeds of your Ummah and the one which are coming down are the outcomes in accordance to their deeds'. If one has done good deeds, he/she is blessed and if one has committed a wrong deed then the outcome is also according to that. </p>
