                        <p>All praise be to Allah - the most Gracious and the Most Merciful, Who has solutions to all our problems. He processes solutions to problems Herein and the Hereafter (Duniya aur Aakhirah). He is the Lord and the only owner of honour, humiliation, success, failure, sickness, health, life and death. To believe that Allah Sustains and Satisfies the needs is all about Imaan. Man gets peace if he firmly believes in destiny and other aspects of Imaan (IMAAN e MOFASSAL). Imaan seeks that reasons and sources must be adopted or discarded in view of Allah's Willingness. Allah Taâ€™ala taught this to Moses through a stick and a serpent. Imaan means believing in the invisible. Allah's book, the Holy Quran, as well as Prophet Mohammad (PBUH) commanded this. Moreover, the work of Dawaah is designed to strengthen Imaan. Unless the materialistic world is rejected, the fragrance of Imaan cannot be smelled. Imaan is a hidden treasure and Allah knows best how much of it one has and this truth will only be exposed at death. All Companions of Prophet (PBUH) were highly afraid of hypocrisy. Fourteen hundred years ago, a Companion (RA) of the Prophet used to say that he found his Imaan weaker as soon as he buried Him (Prophet PBUH). Today, after such a long period, only Allah knows the condition of our Imaan. While all the hypocrites consider themselves to be a firm believer, the true believers are afraid of hypocrisy. The strength of Imaan fluctuates so quickly that one who is considered a believer in the morning becomes a non-believer in the evening and vice-versa. May Allah save us all, Ameen. Imaan grows stronger in the path of Allah where Allah is repeatedly praised and His Greatness and Importance is constantly acknowledged. Imaan turns weak when situations from Allah are associated with the materialistic world. However, it grows stronger when situations are associated to be from Allah. For the believers of Allah, Allah becomes sufficient for them, for the believers of the materialistic world, Allah hands them over to that world. Trust only Allah, never keep any hope on people and materials if you do that you will regret later. One of the beauties of Imaan is ---those possessing it, the materialistic world and situation does not impact their heart much than those whose Imaan is weakened they act the exact opposite and suffer in agony. Striving hard for Imaan develops the importance of good deeds (Aamaal) within the Heart, which is the key to success. When there is confrontation between the Commands of Allah and one's, desires fulfill Allah's Commands but do not violate His Commands, have patience, bear some hardship, sacrifice some comforts temporarily, such as pleasures and materialistic goods, but do not violate the Commands of Allah at any cost, this is the most powerful test of Imaan. Once the Commands of Allah have been fulfilled, Allah will reward us with Imaan and a strong bond with Him and His help and his Hidden Kingdom will favour us. Whenever you see wrong being done, prevent it with your hand if possible. If not, prevent it by speech, but if even that is not possible, then at least take ill at heart. This is the lowest level of Imaan. We should strive and pray for the safety and purity of our Imaan. If you want to Know the present condition of your Imaan judge it from the chapter Effects of Powerful Imaan (faith)</p>
