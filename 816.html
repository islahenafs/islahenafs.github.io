                        <p>Do you have enough knowledge on how to raise good children, achieve good health & manage finance?</p><p>Our life is far away from the Truth and Reality. Allaah has designed the world with various materials, there are things for destruction and there are materials for construction, it is up to you to decide what do you accept or reject? We cannot deny the present world completely. Worldly materials are there to help us, but it will be only helpful as long as we use them according to the Wishes, Commands of Allaah and Sunnah of Prophet (Peace be upon him) but the faith of the material world should not be in our Heart at any cost. Faith (Yaqeen) should be on Allaah only. We need to give top priority to the Love and Obedience of Allaah and His beloved Prophet Mohammad (Peace be upon him) in all situations. To de-stress yourself abandon all self oriented Thoughts, Intellect (Samajh),Talks which are not sanctioned by Sunnah and Shariah in order to keep the Body, Mind and Heart calm from all materialistic impacts and influences and are thus the root causes of all tensions, stress and fatigue. These are not possible without Iman, Yageen & the Noor of Enlightenment which comes only by striving hard from various Divine Path of Deen such as work of Dawah ete.
