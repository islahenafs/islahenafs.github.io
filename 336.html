                        <p>When a newly wed bride becomes a part of your family try and see her good qualities. It has often noticed that at the in-lawsâ€™ house only her faults and short comings are pricked upon which results in more disagreements, disrespect of one another, thereby agonizing everyone from the newly wed bride to the members of the household. As a result, this phase leaves her frightened, distant and she grieves her marital decision. She starts developing hatred and distances herself from them. We forget that our evil deeds such as backbiting (geebah) land in the court of Allah and in return bring displeasure and punishment further making the house chaotic and a difficult place to live. </p>
