                        <p>I have been wanting to write to my readers about the people of Dawaah and followers of Khangah. Without doubt the work of Dawaah is one of the biggest and most important gifts from Allah to this Ummah. But there are times when this work immerses people into itself so much so they neglect and forget there are other priorities equally important for the survival and longevity of Allah's Deen. This gives rise to a belief of its lessened importance. </p>
