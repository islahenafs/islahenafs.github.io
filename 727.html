                        <p>Now every now and then we need to keep our mind empty, filtered from thoughts, relax (do not think) by following silence. We have to fulfill our priorities (Dawah & body's necessities), responsibilities, and duties. It is a fact that some thoughts and problems would always burden us definitely as we carry out our everyday life. However, we should not bogged down with them to the extent that it destroys our peace, happiness, tranquility and drags us to many stress related diseases. To counter hidden destructions we need to hold three principles viz. sacrifice, patience and hardship (Mehnat) firmly. However the bigger question is where will we get that willpower? It is the work of Dawah where we will achieve that power to counter destruction, if we spend quality time in the path of Allah everywhere we need to wait, tolerate, sacrifice and obey. </p>
