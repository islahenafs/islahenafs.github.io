                        <p>The Prophet of Islam is most renowned in the annals of history for the greatest revolution in religious thinking and practice, which he set in motion in the seventh century AD throughout a major part of the civilized world. But what is perhaps lost sight of is that it was not only the strength of his religious conviction, but also his great personal charisma, in a situation fraught with all kinds of adversity, which brought adherents to his side, first of all with painful slowness, then with a heartening acceleration of pace. </p>
