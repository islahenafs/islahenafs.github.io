                        <p>Heart diseases and high blood pressure are common today. People are ignoring diet and sleep pattern these days, which often result in such health issues. When we face any problem, we should quickly look into its possible solutions. Else, it could lead into high blood pressure, which is the mother of all diseases. So, it is imperative to bother about it. Blood pressure is not so easy to control and it can lead to 3 dangerous medical issues: (1) Heart Attack (2) Paralysis (3) Kidney failure. In order to decrease blood pressure we must be less aggressive. If your mind is stressed because of the pressure of work, tension and materials, chances are that your systolic blood would be on higher side but if you are undergoing family related stress, then your diastolic blood pressure would be higher. Try and keep a mild temperament and calm behavior. Try to abandon harshness of the heart and soul. Abandon eating eggs, fish and meat. We should have plain foods that are given to patients in the hospitals. We should stick to a vegetarian diet most of the times. Try and eat less salt. Avoid smoking and use of tobacco in any form. Be calm at work and home. Have sound sleep for eight hours and walk for 45 minutes five times a week. It is necessary for cardiovascular fitness. Do breathing exercises by inhaling and exhaling as per the fitness regime. The mind and lung need oxygen for which we should walk in open spaces. Massage your head, feet and skin regularly. Don't put stress on the mind. Take caution in thinking and talking. Do not live in stressful conditions. Believe in doing charity. Seek Blessings of Allah and the Prophet (Darood-e-Paak) and repent for your sins (tauba and astaghfaar). By doing all this, your blood pressure will automatically come down. If not done as suggested above and rules are broken, blood pressure will never become normal. Do not stop taking medicines for blood pressure without the advice of the doctor. Otherwise, it can lead to trouble. Allah forbid if blood pressure increases at 110-200 in the night, immediately refer to a hospital. Keep blood pressure between 120 and 80 in any case. Do not panic due to the rate of blood pressure. In order to balance the blood pressure it is necessary to strengthen Imaan because though, doubts and memories of a troubled past may disturb a man, if he has Imaan, he will sleep calmly and all doubts will be cleared. May Allah save everyone from being paralyzed. Due to sickness and stress, a patient is not fit to think rationally. So, do not make any decision as per the will of the patient. Have trust in the doctor and act according to his advise. Many times a patient insists that he will not go to the doctor, or to the hospital and refuses to undergo any medical tests. But any such excuse of the patient should not bog one down. Whoever will give in to these excuses may have to face the brunt and pay for it heavily. So, in spite of all attempts, if you are unable to sleep, you may take a medicine to fall asleep, because lack of sleep can be more dangerous than taking a sleeping tablet. Life is so fast today and that's the reason for our restlessness and impatience. One should be in constant and regular touch with a good doctor and get all parameters checked regularly like blood pressure, blood sugar and cholesterol level. However don't just blindly base your judgement to one doctor's opinion, consider a second opinion. </p>
