                        <p>Do not leave people on their own, as far as you can. Help them to overcome their weaknesses by counselling and help them to improve themselves. Tell them as what is good and otherwise. This will help him/her to change and be steadfast on the right path. By the grace of Allah, Dawaah and Khanqahai system is fulfilling this admirably. </p>
