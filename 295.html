                        <p>Very often we hear about the break down in inter personal relations among husband & wife, Mother in law & daughter inlaw, employee & employers and this is in vogue everywhere. Man doesn't realise his bad breath but others do, similarly if someone notices a flaw or short coming listen to it carefully. Its one of the reasons why one should receive mentorship under a Mashaikh (pious) so his flaws can be addressed and rectifed. I know only two solutions to this problem. </p><p>Follow the tradition (Sunnah) of Prophet (peace be upon him)</p><p>Work hard and strive to win over the other through the sheer power of love and service Allah willing this will help to overcome the problem </p>
