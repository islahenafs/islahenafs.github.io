                        <p>The easy way to sleep is to lie down according to Sunnah. When the head touches the pillow, do not bother about anything because it will put burden on the mind and you will be sleepless. Moreover, you will waste your time. When you are able to overcome this aspect, you will manage to sleep. As long as you are awake, repeat the name of Allah and seek His Blessings upon the Prophet (Darood). Then you will be able to sleep soon. Sleep is a bounty of nature to comfort human beings. But our stress and thoughts destroy it. The Satan wastes our time and destroys the sleep by bringing unwanted ideas to the mind. </p><p>There are some pain, sufferings and diseases which can be only cured by the grace of Allah through deep sleep and in company of wife such as insomnia, stress and frustration. </p>
