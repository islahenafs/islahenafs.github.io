                        <p>Why do people not act upon advice? (Log Aamaal kyun nehi kar pate?) </p><p>Some people do not have the capability to focus on their target. Their attention keeps wayward and they lose their focus </p><p>Some people do not have the capabilities to plan to carry out a work in time. </p><p>Some people want to do some work but they are too lazy to do it. </p><p>Some people are too immersed in their comforts and luxuries and are involved in cigarette and chewing tobacco so they are sleepy most of the time. </p><p>Such people are not too bothered about their future or the end result. They are not aware of the satisfaction one drives by carryout a virtuous act. This also happens due to weak will power.</p><p>Our environment also affects us a great deal. If the environment is not conducive to work then people are not able to overcome the challenges and flow with the tide. They become too lazy and most of the time spend time in useless chatter. </p><p>Satanic obstacles also work as impediments when we try to carry out any virtuous act. E.g. People may visit us or we may get a phone call and this results in the distraction of the work. </p><p>It takes several days and months to cultivate a habit to do a good work. It does not get developed overnight. </p>
