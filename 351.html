                        <p>Satan can mislead any person and make him commit sins except those who fear Allah and have strong faith in Allah. When we dedicate our lives and wealth in the path of Allah (Dawah) then we would see that Allah would bestow upon us these two blessings. Allah would help us in our day to day activity. All obstacles and hardships would get removed one after another by the grace of Allah. If you do not put hard work in the path of Allah and earn for this world then this is no earning as there won't be any Barakah in the same. </p>
