                        <p>About that a little narration: we should know that our Prophet Hazrat Muhammad (PBUH) had spent his life at 2 places as a Prophet. In Makkah and Madinah--a total 23 years. The first 13 years at Makkah and the next 10 years spent in Madinah. In Makkah he (PBUH) worked with his Sahabah to develop a strong Imaan. That was his only mission and aim. Once Imaan had deep rooted itself the Commands of Allah were fulfilled without any difficulty. Then when the Prophet (PBUH) moved to Madinah and spent the 10 years, the guidelines from Allah SWT started pouring in. Sahabah began following it one after another (Salah, Hijab, prohibiting usury and alcohol). His companions (RA) followed them too without difficulty because of their strong Imaan. Nowadays its uncommon to see people trying to perfect their Imaan (faith) instead they desire to have an ideal life. Unless our Imaan is perfected we cannot obey the Commands of Allah and cannot differentiate between good and evil. This explains the importance of Imaan in shaping a perfect life. The work of Dawah is a unique struggle to develop Imaan. The inception of which, was by Hazrat Maulana Ilyas sahab Reh. This effort was made to replicate efforts of the Prophet PBUH and the course he took 1437 years back. Quran and Hadith have clearly mentioned if we don't strive in the path of Allah for the survival of His Deen instead are busy enjoying life with worldly bounties, they all will be in trouble. </p>
