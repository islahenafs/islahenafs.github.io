                        <p>While performing an activity it is important to concentrate on that particular work and one should not digress. One should not bother about too many things otherwise he will be confused. One should concentrate on the work one has started and do it with full confidence. Also it is necessary to take proper rest and sleep because mind is supposed to do important activities. If the mind is tired and exhausted then it will not work properly. </p>
