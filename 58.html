                        <p>The work of Dawaah will be more damaged by its followers than the non- followers. Negligence of the 4th point of Tableegh - Ekram-e-Muslemin which holds an important stature in Islam. Instead we're starting to follow the attitude of Taâ€™assub, nepotism (favourism) towards your own people. There is nothing but more chaos in-store. Now this can translate within a house, society, community or Tableegh. Its suffering isn't limited to this world but would get carried to the Hereafter. </p>
