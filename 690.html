                        <p>If someone is deprived of food and water for long, he declines in physical health. If this continues over a long period of time, it eventually leads to his physical starvation. In the same way, if anyone is deprived of spiritual sustenance for a long time, his soul suffers. If this continues over a long period of time, it eventually leads to his spiritual starvation. </p>
