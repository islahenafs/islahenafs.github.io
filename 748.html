                        <p>I would like to clear some misconceptions about dreams. Those who are really pious and virtuous people, they often dream good but those who are dirty minded people and commit sins, they dream invariably through Satan's influence. At times Satan wants to harass good people by making them dream awkward things so that their peace gets destroyed. </p>
