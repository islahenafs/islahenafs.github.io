                        <p>One should try to save himself and his family before doing it for others. Many a times people spend their time, effort and money on others to such an extent that they themselves and their family members land up in awkward positions. I have observed in aircrafts that people wear life jackets first before helping others. Fire brigade people wear the necessary uniform and use right equipment to help the fire victims. Therefore we should try to help ourselves and our family members first. There is a famous saying - charity begins at home. Allah also says in His book to save yourself and your family members from the fire of hell. </p>
