                        <p>Due to excessive Zikr of Allah, the bodies of some people start generating a lot of heat. Those who follow this tremulous path of lot of Zikr should realize that their food intake must be cold in nature. Foods such as fruits and vegetables be increased in diet. Food that is hot and spicy in nature such as meat and fish should be minimum in consumption, failing to which the body would generate excessive heat and disturb its internal hot and cold balance. Dont drink freezing cold water as it is bad for kidneys. </p>
