                        <p>What are the symptoms of a damaged spiritual heart? </p><p>Basically, it is Imaan which gets destroyed since its in the heart which becomes disturbed. Therefore once Imaan is ruined the relationship with Allah is lost and the person gets looped into a negative spiral- gets upset and starts searching for peace in materialistic things. Their actions become rude towards others and they consider the material world as their ultimate solution and begin racing towards it. What they don't realize is, the more they reach out towards it, the more their problems become complex. Almost to the point that every material object starts functioning opposite to its own nature. </p><p>Hatred for fellow human beings develops. </p><p>Situations will occur such that people, animals and even the materialistic world will act peculiarly towards one. </p><p>Anger will unnecessarily flare up. </p><p>Peace of mind will be lost. </p><p>Obstructions will trouble one. </p><p>Nothing will be in one's favour. </p><p>One will only see other's short-comings and flaws. </p><p>One will not take much interest in the obedience of Allah's Commands and Prophet's PBUH Sunnah and doing Ibadat. </p><p>One will not get proper sleep. </p><p>In the end, only frustration, agony and arrogance will surround one. Allah forbid, if he / she dies in this condition they will be destined to the fire of Hell. </p><p>The Prophet Mohammad PBUH said: “There is a piece of flesh dwelling in the human body. If it is flawless, the whole body is faultless, but if it is corrupt, the entire body is badly affected. This flesh is called the heart.” </p><p>Its often noticed that the heart gets unifocused towards one subject and goes "All-in" with great intensity despite the obstacles, odds, troughs along the way. This is seen in people with high determination. Although this helps in the completion of the task, it's not always a good sign. You must understand the need of the hour and plan your move. Hazrat Maulana Zubair Sahib RA advice on this matter is- Moderation (atedaal). </p><p>Cardiovascular heart will never remain perfect until and unless body moves and does some physical activity such as walking and exercises. </p>
