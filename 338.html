                        <p>Those who are most active after Magrib Salah suffer more stress and undergo a damaging sleep pattern as opposed to the others active xsafter fajr. Notice all animals and birds become silent in the evening. They sleep early, get up early and look freshness. When sun rises in the morning one should not sleep. It is natures way of awakening everything. There are massive changes that take place in the atmosphere for the conversion of night to day. In Islam it is important to be awake until Israq. Day by day we are distancing ourselves from nature and its set patterns and this is taking a hazardous form of health illnesses as a result. </p>
