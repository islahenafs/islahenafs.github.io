                        <p>The cure of Nafs looks like thisâ€” a person now dislikes what he was once very fond of e.g a person enjoyed committing a certain sin such as watching movies, womanising, drugs etc. but once he enters spirituality and the divine kingdom of Allah, his spirit drove him away from those vices. However, this can happen only when a person has gotten divine intervention and has overcome many of his worldly desires. Once he gets the taste of spirituality, his belief system gets strengthened. </p>
