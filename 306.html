                        <p>Very often we hear about the break down in inter personal relations among husband & wife, Mother in law & daughter inlaw, employee & employers and this is in vogue everywhere. Man doesn't realise his bad breath but others do, similarly if someone notices a flaw or short coming listen to it carefully.
