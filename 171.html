                        <p>Use of cigarettes, tobacco and gutka once or twice doesn't cause cancer. It's the prolonged and excessive usage that causes illness. Keep your distance from these ills because they do great harm to the digestive system and make the body and mind weak. Due to consuming pesticides through edible foods numerous diseases are cropping up, but the government is not banning them. </p>
