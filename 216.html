                        <p>Allah will bring no change to the sect of people who take no effort in reforming themselves. That is why it is very important to reform the Nafs, because of ignorance one should not take a wrong step, which might result in punishment now or Hereafter. Apart from this, there is another purpose that needs our attention - the divine kingdom of Allah should be in our favour along with rewards and achievements. So as when death comes, we go in the state of perfect belief (Kamil Imaan). I have often heard these words from pious people </p><p>â€œAll human beings are dead except the ones who possess knowledge. All learned people will be destroyed if they haven't acted in accordance to their knowledge. All performers will be destroyed if they are not devout enough to please Allah (Ikhlas). At the end all devout and sincere (Mukhlis) people are also under the spectre of great danger. </p>
