                        <p>Don't try to overrule someone's ideology. If the second person is a layman or a novice and is ignorant about certain ways and things, it becomes a challenge to change his/her views. Everybody's struggle is different. They are made to face different tests/challenges and that is why they are made differently. Intellectual people do not argue but those who are arrogant and proud do. </p>
