                        <p>Allah is the sole owner of Noor, Peace, Ability, Comfort and Happiness; so beg (Dua) from Him so that all these land in our heart, environment and material world. Make sure that worldly pleasures such as food & luxury and carelessness (Ghaflat) should not influence your body, mind and heart. If various adversity, discomforts and tribulations surround you, first pause, have patience then think for what reason are you facing these adversity ? Have you committed a sin or done a mistake? Then, watch your thoughts, speech, and actions; which should not violate the Commands of Allah& Sunnah of Prophet (PBUH), rather it should please Allah more. </p>
