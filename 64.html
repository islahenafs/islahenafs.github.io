                        <p>There are two very powerful facets of this work one â€” on how it strengthens Imaan and the other the sacrificing of Nafs giving strength to temporarily giving up homely comfort such as your wife, children and business. When one acts against his Nafs it's reformation begins. The path of Allah is against our Nafs. Secondly the repeated conversing and listening about Allah time and again strengthens that Imaan. A strengthened Imaan will change the very course of our life. </p>
