                        <p>Reformation is a monumental task. It is humongous task to achieve perfection in it. One must put in effort towards it. Prefer a peaceful life - whether in matters of Deen or the materialistic world. You will be exhausted performing good deeds but Allah will never be tired of rewarding you. Practice moderation at all stages, else desires (Nafs) will destroy you. The Prophet PBUH possessed the strength of 40 wrestlers yet Allah warned him through an ayah in the Quran addressing the Prophet “O Prophet! Will you destroy yourself if the non-believers do not become believers?” </p>
