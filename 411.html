                        <p>The most tolerant of all men, he was very gracious, kind-hearted, and invariably polite and considerate of the well-being of others. He claimed no right to take precedence over his fellow men, walking behind his Companions generally with his eyes cast down, refusing to take a position of prominence at gatherings and always greeting others first. He treated everyone equally, making no distinction between rich and poor, would gladly accept the invitation of slaves and servants, and when mixing with them, would exhibit no pride whatsoever. He never affected the airs of a great man. He would put people from all walks of life at their ease, whether joining in their celebrations or caring for the sick and needy. No one was ever made by him to feel disheartened or despairing. Whenever anyone came to consult him about anything, he would give him a patient hearing and wait respectfully until he had had his say. In fact, he always used to behave so open-heartedly that each person he encountered left him feeling that he (the Prophet) loved him best of all. A person in need was always given something by him, and if he had nothing to give at that particular time, he would always promise to give something later. In fact, he was never known to have acted in a miserly way. In company, his manners were perfect, particularly in the way he sat and ate. He would never eat on a full stomach and avoided over-rich, spicy food. He would never complain that something tasted or smelt bad. He would simply not eat it and at the most would refrain from praising it. When it was his turn to play the host, he would entertain his guests to the best of his ability, speaking light-heartedly, and modestly, and occupying any place which he was given. He would smile but he would not laugh loudly. He always spoke softly, for he disliked any noise or fighting or disorder, and would even address his enemy gently. Always at pains to maintain harmony in all his relationships, he took good care never to malign anyone, even in the face of blatant misconduct. </p>
