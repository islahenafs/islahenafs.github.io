                        <p>A true Muslim does not believe in breach of trust and never breaks his promises. Insincerity towards commitments is a serious flaw. Satan puts in all efforts to make a person forget his commitments. So, while someone is waiting for the promise to be fulfilled, the person who has committed himself forgets about it. At times, commitments are made ina manner where several people are involved. For example: You have invited someone over dinner and while your family members prepared food for the guests, but the guest didn't turn up. This can be extremely upsetting for all concerned. </p>
