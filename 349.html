                        <p>These days people are getting hurt/ discomforted by the excessive usage of the mobile phones intentionally or unintentionally. If a person calls you and you are not able to collect the call for whatever reason(s) then he/she starts speculating and feels hurt. One must remember that if a person has dialed you a phone then he/she might have dialed you for some specific reason. It is similar to knocking on someone's door and no one responding to that. If you are not able to respond to the call then you must call back whenever you get time. These are one of the teachings of Islam. I have personally dialed many a great scholars/ servants of Islam. They pick up or responds call immediately else would always call back. However, people tend to ignore phone calls of their friends, relatives, colleagues and employees. This is a very bad practice. </p>
