                        <p>The world is a place to strive. Nobody is at comfort forever. One has to keep striving and be patient. These facets are integrated with life. Human desires are only interested in comfort and pleasure; because of this the mentality of hardship is becoming weaker by the day. Everybody should practice hardships according to their strength, stamina and willpower. This is one of the most important aspect of life, all beauty of Islam is hidden in it. If you see observe the life of prophet PBUH and his pious Companions you might be able to quantify the amount of hardships and pain they could endure. </p>
