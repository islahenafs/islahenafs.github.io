                        <p>One must evaluate carefully before every transaction or interactions. These days people befriend strangers over WhatsApp and Facebook and then rue things later on. Difficulty is a great teacher for our reformation but none of us like it. However, Allah cures many of our physical and spiritual ailments through difficulties so we should pay attention to that facet as well. One must pray Allah and follow the traditions of our Prophet Hazrat Muhammad (PBUH) at all times to get benefitted from these situations. One should be fearful of Allah and obey Him regularly. </p>
