                        <p>Allah-fearing men should be cautious of some women (na mehram). Men are biologically programmed to lust for women. Hence, due to being misled by Satan the Wisdom of a man goes for a toss and he gives in to unholy desires. Meeting them on the sly, without the knowledge of the family, or traveling with them, thinking about them or chatting over the phone on WhatsApp and Facebook should be avoided with na mehram women. Whoever does so will be misled by Satan and Satan will enthuse forbidden (haraam) desires in their mind. As a result they will not only spoil their life and duniya but the Hereafter as well. The degree of loss of that misguided person is best known to Allah Taâ€™ala only. The Satan tries to trap a person by misleading that his lust is love and is justified, but remember that Satan is misguiding him. </p>
