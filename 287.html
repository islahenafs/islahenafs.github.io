                        <p>Once I asked my dear friend Ahmed Irfan sahib-- why do we face problems, whether is it Azmaish or written in our destiny? To that he comely replied, "Azmaish and Tests are for the highly pious people. Each of us faces problems for the sins we have committed in the past or bad and evil deeds have done or took wrong (Haram) step in our life. So Tauba, Ashtagfar, Tears and following right path is our ultimate solutions to escape the punishment of both Duniya and Akherah. </p>
