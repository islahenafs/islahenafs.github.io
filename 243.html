                        <p>Today there are a lot of differences developing between Muslims and non-Muslims, by the spontaneous media coverage. To be honest, some ignorant Muslims behave in an unjust manner. Let's hypothetically say: Today Mr. Michael steals something, but the entire Christianity will not be blamed. Similarly, if Mr. Shivram kills someone, people will solely blame Mr. Shivram for his act but his religion, Hinduism, will not be blamed. But if Mr. Abdul Jabbar commits a crime, people will not blame Mr. Abdul Jabbar alone, but the Muslim community as a whole. This is what media is doing and blaming all Muslims and Islam. Muslims have to stay with non-Muslims and vice versa. We are all Creations of Allah, who has created us in one religion but in different communities. A famous writer, the late Mohammad Rafique Zakaria sahib used to always say that we should take as much good as possible from non- Muslims, without compromising with our religion, faith, dignity and respect. We may not like many things, but we must do so for the sake of peace and harmony, just as our Prophet (PBUH) did at the time of Suleh-Hudaibya. </p>
