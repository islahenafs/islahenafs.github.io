                        <p>Actions have consequences. It's when you forget consequences and commit a mistake during performance disaster takes form. Often think that I am weak, dependent on Allah, ignorant and know nothing. Remain focused to present subject and sufferings. Try to stop thinking and keep the mind empty, relaxed and filtered. These are powerful tools of the mind. Excess Vital Life force (Nafs) should not enter in your thoughts to create more stress and chaos. For Hereafter: Think of Imaan, virtuous deeds (Aamaal e Saleha) and self control. For present World: Follow moderation, work towards achieving sufficient knowledge for successful execution and fulfilling priorities, responsibilities and rights with sincerity and dedication. Forgive people, control five senses, try to keep your heart clean, transparent and free of ill feelings about others. May Allah protect us from the adversities of brawls, quarrels, anger, torture and conflict! Do tauba and astagfar so He may distance the ill feelings away. Those who do not understand the importance of priorities will suffer throughout life, the most. State the problem first and amicably find its’ solution. So meticulously plan and perform well (Aamaal). Correct decision and timely right action will save you from all chaos, If decision making involves emotions, anger and haste - they will be wrong decisions. The right ones are made with a rational mind and an understanding of the situation. Never forget the “Test of Allah”. If you follow these guidelines I am sure Allah will provide you Peace and help. </p>
