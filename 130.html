                        <p>May Allah grant us the quality of a steed! We should learn to abide by the rules. We should be capable to move and stop (as the horse acts and stops at the command of the whip and rein). Pious people have to be cautious and watchful of what they are preaching and follow - is it accordance with the Quran and the path of the Prophet (PBUH). This must be always monitored whether during happy or grievous times. May Allah Taâ€˜ala Bless us all now and forever! May Allah weed out the ill feelings and poor habits of a person. We all face laziness (Ghaflat) during the time of repentance (Tauba) and performance (Aamaal). One must be sincere towards these things. There is no way to penance from punishment of Duniya and Hereafter except Tauba (Repentance). </p>
