                        <p>Some diseases cause weakness in the body and affect our thinking capabilities. It also leads to dreaming in the night and people assume that it is a blessing if the dreams are good and an agony if the dreams are bad. They run from pillar to post to find out the meaning (taabeer) of the dream from different sources. This kind of behaviour is in a way an attack from Satan. Dream has a very special place in Islam which comes from Allah SWT to guide mankind, it is one of best form of guidance which directly comes from Allah but at times it comes from Satan too. Read the book on dreams by Hazrat Maulana IBN e Seereen RA to understand the depth and secret of dreams. </p>
