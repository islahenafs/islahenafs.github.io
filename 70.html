                        <p>It is a basic principle not to eat until you are hungry. Also, stop eating while there is still some hunger left. This means, always leave some space in the stomach and do not eat and fill your stomach to its full capacity. It is important to chew the food slowly. Do not drink water immediately after having food otherwise your digestive system will be in trouble. </p>
