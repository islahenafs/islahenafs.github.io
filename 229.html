                        <p>Right from childhood, slavery of Nafs should be strictly prohibited because later on, it can become difficult to change mind sets. Therefore, children should be kept away from becoming slaves of their Nafs. Sadly, parents these days do little to keep their children from following their Nafs. Negative traits, shortcomings and weaknesses like addiction, ignorance of consequences, pleasure, arrogance, forgetfulness and mind slavery are a great drawback in life. Time and again one will have erratic desires and Satan will try to instigate these traits in the mind and heart to destroy one's inner peace and harmony. In order to counter this effectively we must seek knowledge, bear hardships, have self-control and learn to sacrifice, have patience and set our priorities. Without these characteristics none can protect themselves from destruction. The best in the world have very high level of execution and intelligence; they get things done fast. </p>
