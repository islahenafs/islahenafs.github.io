                        <p>Of-course that does not mean that the person spending time in the path of Allaah will be an intellectual or will master the secret of the heart and mind or that he falsely believes he is superior to other people (Ulemas especially). Clearly a deception driven thought process. Workers of Dawaah must remember one thing, Sahabah not only sacrificed their lives in the path of Allah but also spent quality time with our beloved Prophet Mohammad PBUH company. Their tarbeith was carried out by Huzur Sws(PBUH). All the Taabayii took tarbieth from Sahabah R.A. and all the Tabe Tabeyee took Tarbieth from Taabayii R.A. and this remained the sequence. Today a similar sequence is absolutely missing. It gives me grief to state that the Nafs is no more rectified in the way it should. People are not attached to Mashayaks, some considering Dawaah as the be-all-and- end-all for ultimate reformation, I like to believe otherwise. </p><p>I have had the blessed opportunity to spend quality time with the most pious of Sheikhs and Mashayaks. The book that I have written is the essence of their teaching. Great personalities as Hazrat Maulana Illyus Sahib R.A-the founder of mission of Dawaah was himself deeply attached to Hazrat Maulana Emdadullah Mohajir Makki R.A. and was baiâ€™at with him. Not only this, very often he spent time with Hazrat Raipuri at Raipur and Hazrat Gangoi R.A. at Gango (Uttar Pradesh). Another prominent personality late Hazrat Maulana Ali Mian Nadwi sahib R.A. often travelled to Saharanpur and spent time with Hazrat Maulana Zakaria Sahib R.A. </p><p>I feel these narrations are enough to understand the importance of Khanqgah and an Allah-walah. </p><p>Lastly, I have heard how often the some Khanqah people obstruct the followers of Tableeghi Jamat from undertaking the pilgrimage. I strongly feel this shouldn't be the case. </p>
