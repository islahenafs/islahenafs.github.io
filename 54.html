                        <p>Be extremely cautious while performing the work of Dawaah as it a precious thing to Allah SWT, do not create any hindrance or commit any mistake towards Dawaah, as it is a very auspicious duty of Allah's innocent messengers. In the past, as history bears witness, many powerful nations and people have been destroyed, who created obstruction in the path of Dawaah. Allah has Bestowed on us this blessings, often said â€œdiamond of prophet hood. So, pray for the development of Dawaah and strive hard for its cause. People are watching us and noticing our behavior and our way of life and living style. Hence, we must be careful to practice what we preach. And our actions should not betray our words. They should rather be alike. </p>
