                        <p>One should think his wrongdoings are the root cause of all the problems. He needs to reform himself first. He must go to the path of Allah for his own reformation. On the contrary, he blames others and feels the other person must reform himself. Instead of doing that he must go to path of Allah. It is a place where good qualities are exchanged amongst each other, if you know some Deen then teach others if you do not then learn from others. </p>
