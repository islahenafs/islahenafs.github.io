                        <p>How to go ahead with spirituality? </p><p>Everybody's effort and struggle is different from another and Allah does their reform (Islah) according to his/her own situation, that is why it is very difficult to suggest or write something which is standard for everyone as a ready reckoner. However, I have tried few things which are very common to our daily life. </p><p>Initiate the process to enter the realm of spirituality by the constant and consistent Zikr (Remembrance) of Allah. Once we start the Zikr with Ikhlas (sincerity of intent) then the Zikr would enter our heart and would cleanse the heart from dirt, malice and worldly things. We need to pray Allah to cleanse our heart and gift with Imaan, Yaqeen (concrete belief), fear of Allah, Ikhlas (pleasing Allah) and Sunnah (way of life of Prophet Mohammad PBUH). </p><p>Once we follow these dedicatedly we will realize that some divine power is developing within ourselves. This is known as the power of Imaan, the most important asset of a man/ woman. Now while doing this we have to remain focused to see what is happening in the mind. During and after any action, mind starts thinking and analyzing. Human brain is strongly related with five sensory organs and past events. In general during any situation/circumstances human brain is always trying to retrieve something from the repository of past events and sending those messages to the mind to stimulate the thoughts, so that mind diverts to somewhere else leaving behind the present work in hand. If a person is able to control it, then Satan and Nafs will try to work on senses, so that the person takes impact from the materialistic world and its people and start thinking about those things, again leaving behind the present work in hand. The quality of work suffers when the person is not able to concentrate on the job in hand. We can experiment these while trying to sleep. </p>
