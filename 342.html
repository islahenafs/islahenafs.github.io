                        <p>Hazrat Wathilah bin Al-Asqa’ (May Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (PBUH) said, “Do not express pleasure at the misfortune of a (Muslim) brother lest Allah should bestow mercy upon him and make you suffer from a misfortune.” [At-Tirmidhi] Commentary: A true believer is one who feels unhappy to see Muslims suffering, and rejoices on the happiness of his other fellows in Faith. It is contrary to the conduct of a true believer to rejoice over the trouble of another Muslim as this attitude is very much disliked by Allah. There is every possibility that Allah may punish such a person in this world and relieve the one who is in trouble. </p>
