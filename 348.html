                        <p>The cure of Nafs is that a person dislikes what he was fond of earlier. E.g. a person was fond of music, movies etc. but once he got an initiation in the spirituality his spirit drives him away from these things. However, this can happen only when a person has got divine intervention and he has overcome his worldly desires. Once he gets a taste of spirituality, his belief gets strengthened. He starts disliking what he was fond of earlier. This is called the cure of Nafs. However, this cannot be attained without the hard yards in the field of belief and the pursuit of truth. </p>
