                        <p>The Pious usually remain in pain even if they try hard to achieve a certain amount of comfort. This is perhaps because Allaah wants to repeatedly test them. All the prophets and his companions despite being the most exalted of all human beings have been repeatedly put through tests. Allah has His own yardstick of measurement. </p>
