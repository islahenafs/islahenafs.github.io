                        <p>By the grace of Allah Ta‘ala spouse is a great gift from Allah Ta'ala. We should understand their weaknesses and without finding faults and taunting them, must forgive them and treat them with love and affection. We must try to lighten the burden of our wives by sharing responsibilities. A woman is an asset and a blessing for the entire family. Through your spouse Allah Ta‘ala has arranged a situation of comfort and blessings for you and your children. These are the teachings of the Prophet (PBUH). He has also advised the Ummah to forgive and treat the women of the house with respect and dignity. Women are a mystery and nobody really knows what is going on in their brain except Allah. It's noted their brain is busy multi tasking. Yes, there are times they act child-like, other times like a princess, at times as a dictator and sometimes like Hazrat Rabia Bashri RA, so it is really hard to handle them without alteration in your ways. </p>
