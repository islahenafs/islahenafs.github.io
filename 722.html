                        <p>How to survive a heart attack when alone? </p><p>1. Let’s say it’s 7.25pm and you’re going home (alone of course) after an unusually hard day on the job. </p><p>2. You’re really tired, upset and frustrated. </p><p>3. Suddenly you start experiencing severe pain in your chest that starts to drag out into your arm and up in to your jaw. You are only about five km from the hospital nearest your home. </p><p>4. Unfortunately you don’t know if you’ ll be able to make it that far. </p><p>5. You have been trained in CPR, but the guy that taught the course did not tell you how to perform it on yourself. </p><p>6. Since many people are alone when they suffer a heart attack without help, the person whose heart is beating improperly and who begins to feel faint, has only about 10 seconds left before losing consciousness. </p><p>7. However, these victims can help themselves by coughing repeatedly and very vigorously. A deep breath should be taken before each cough, and the cough must be deep and prolonged, as when producing sputum from deep inside the chest. </p><p>8. Abreath and a cough must be repeated about every two seconds without let- up until help arrives, or until the heart is felt to be beating normally again. </p><p>9. Breathe deeply! Get oxygen into the lungs and cough to squeeze the heart and keep the blood circulating. The squeezing pressure on the heart also helps it regain normal rhythm. In this way, heart attack victims can get to a hospital. </p><p>Tell as many other people as possible about this. It could save their lives. </p>
