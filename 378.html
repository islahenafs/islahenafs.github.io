                        <p>While speaking to people in congregation, keep in mind the following guidelines:</p><p>First see the gatherings, take assessment what kind of people you are going to deliver your speech. </p><p>Keep your own reality in your eyes, what you were and what you are. </p><p>Explain clearly that success is in Deen only. Try to cultivate more interest and curiosity (Ta'laab) of Deen </p><p>Language must be soft, polite and gentle </p><p>Speech should not be too lengthy, that the people become bored and leave the gathering. Short speech has more impact. Prophet PBUH sayings are very short.</p><p>While talking turn your face to all sides in the front. </p><p>Some important sentences may be repeated twice. So that masses can easily understand. </p><p>When you quote a Hadith use the word by saying similar to this (Mafhoom) then quote the Hadith. </p><p>Be positive. Most of the time heart does not accept negative approaches. Talk more about Heaven. </p><p>Never try to criticise any one. </p><p>Out come from your speech should be like this. Heart should turn from Duniya to Hereafter, From creations to Creators ( Allah) and from idling to action. </p>
