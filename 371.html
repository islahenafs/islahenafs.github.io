                        <p>Whatever message we share through WhatsApp and other Social media apps should be duly verified especially when it is pertaining to religion. All those message should be implemented in our daily lives and it should be reflected through our actions. If it doesn't happen then people would get disillusioned and get astray from guidance. You must have noticed that many people spend nearly 18 hours on phone giving tips to others. This is not the right way to lead a life. These people would also talk about as how one should spend his life whereas their own life schedule is haywire. </p>
