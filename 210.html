                        <p>Some people say that they will not go to their place of business because no customers turn up. We must learn to be patient. We can take lesson from the patience of the lizard we usually get to see in our homes. You can see as how it waits near the light endlessly. Allah surrounds the place with insects for the lizard to feed upon. Similarly, if you spend time at your place of business, Allah will send customers to you. It is important to be self-sufficient. It is often said that the world requires wealth and the Hereafter - good deeds (Aamaal). Aman must not leave his children poor. We are so accustomed to extravagance that the moment money comes to us; it goes out of our pockets. Everyone does not have the bandwidth to save money. A millionaire woman once said, “In my life, I have saved coins in a very careful manner.” </p><p>The CEO of a successful IT Company once said to me, “Look after your people, look after your customers”, I feel these are two most important facets of running a successful business organization. </p><p>I once inquired from a CEO as a successful IT, The secret of his Chairman's success. His reply took me by great surprise and inspiration. He said, " The Chairman is extremely focused to his subject of attention, to the extent when we attend a meeting he succinctly maintains the points of discussion and does not deviate from the subject. There is no other point discussed other than the ones he intended to at the on-start of the meet”. </p>
