                        <p>Everybody may be rectified but not the lazy one. A lazy person just wastes his time in thinking, looking around and bragging about his achievements of the past. He gives advice to others but doesn't apply the same upon himself. He is deprived of action and deeds. There is no synchronization between his words and his actions. Prophet Mohammad PBUH said "The destruction of man lies in three (things): from stomach, lust and tongue." I often say: “Become a performer on the field (action) than orating from the pulpit (Mimbar).” </p>
