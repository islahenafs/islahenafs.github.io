                        <p>Always try and follow the path of the Prophet PBUH. Do not be digressed in different directions. There would be many things around, which you will try and engulf yourself in or they will attract you. So, be strong willed and do not give in to those activities and erroneous thoughts. The important aspect is that you have to practice and perform as per the Sunnah and stay on the righteous path. Remember that actions (Aamaal) decide your fate in the world and Hereafter. Sadly, most people are not aware of this. </p>
