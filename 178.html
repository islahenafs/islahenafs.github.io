                        <p>A famous proverb-whatever happens, happens by Allah's Wishes. everything ranging from the condition of the human heart to the condition of a person's overall life and situations, all happens under His Supreme Command. Allah's Greatness must be involved in every matter through Duas and supplications, involve Him in all your activities needs and deeds. Once Prophet PBUH forgot to say Insha- Allaah ta’‘ala, he had to go without communication with Allah for two weeks, revelations were stopped for two weeks and he was really upset. If one does not involve Allah in all his matters, Allah does not help him in his work; this is a fact. </p>
