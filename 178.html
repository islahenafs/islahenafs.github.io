                        <p>Offer Salaah/Namaaz with all your heart, recite the Holy Quran impeccably and remember Allah while worshiping. Alhamdulillah </p><p>Salaah/Namaz is such an important gift that only Allah and Prophet PBUH know its depth. It is the same for everyone but different people offer prayer and supplications at a different levels and get rewarded differently. An ordinary Muslim prays specific way, and a Pious( Muttaqi) man prays in a different way, Wali (friends) of Allah pray ina different way. Prophet PBUH used to pray at an altogether different level. They all get different levels of solace, peace, Noor and rewards. To me the best way of praying is protect your senses while praying and keep the mind empty filtered and relaxed so that all Zikr starts from the heart (Qalb) and the Noor of Zikr touches the heart. Make sure that vasvasa & grief, which come from the heart, and thoughts which come from the mind (Memory), should not interfere with your Zikr. Always remember that Allah is watching you. Salaah/Namaaz must be offered with these qualities. May the bygone memories not distract you during your good deeds (Aamaal). </p>
