                        <p>It is an embedded problem of man that, often he cannot use his capacity and capabilities appropriately, because of lack of proper guidance and knowledge, or laziness or mind slavery, and Allah Taâ€˜ala knows the best. If capabilities and capacities are invested rightly, then the present and the future can be brightened. Allah forbid if these capabilities (time, money and efforts) are utilized in an inappropriate manner, then the Herein and Hereafter will be ruined. Use your capacity and capabilities proportionately towards all aspects of life. Whatever little opportunities and resources are available to you, use them sensibly. If you wait for a better opportunity, you might lose the one in hand. It is universally accepted that opportunity knocks the door only once. </p>
