                        <p>Civilized and honorable people are fortunate, while uncivilized people are unfortunate. May Allah save all Muslim Ummah from ego and darkness of illiteracy (jahaalat). The ego is a negative trait while self- respect is a positive trait. But many people are unable to differentiate between these two and hence get embroiled into unnecessary hassles. It is said that the honour of a person lies under his control. He may sustain it or may lose it by his own behavior and deeds. The humble the person, the happier he is and lives a long and cherished life. “We are nothing and we know nothing” is a lovely notion, which provides so much peace to mind. </p>
