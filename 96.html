                        <p>To help people, to cooperate with relatives, neighbors, the vulnerable, the poor and the needy, to help orphans and widows - are the teaching symbols and glory of Islam. Being on good terms with relatives (sil-a-rehmi) pleases Allah Taâ€˜ala. We should not have malice and jealousy towards our relatives and should not fight with them over petty issues. We should be humble and careful while dealing with our relatives and friends and give them due consideration because if a relationship breaks, it can cause pain and agony to all in the family. </p>
