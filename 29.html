                        <p>Strengthen your Imaan, Yaqeen and Taqwa (piety) by acknowledging Allah's Greatness, His Might and reciting Zikr of Allah. Control your speech as it is the root cause of many evils. Force your body to follow the Sunnah, Sayings and Manners and Etiquette of Prophet (PBUH). Develop patience, perseverance and passion for sacrifice in the mind. Otherwise, the five senses will be influenced by the materialistic world and start erratic behavior such as tyranny and bad temper. Try to increase your threshold of tolerance in the mind so that the mind does not go to wrong directions by seeing some displeasure. Satan is our hidden enemy. We don't see him but he sees us, and his tricks are so devious that even intelligentsia, at times fail to identify him. One has to always be alert and cautious. </p>
