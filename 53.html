                        <p>The main objective of this book is to rectify and reform Nafs. When one goes out in the path Allah for the cause of Dawaah and spends time with correct principles, Allah reforms him in the best way because it involves sacrifice and living a principled life in the environment of a Mosque. Dawaah is such a unique work by way of which the Deen of Allah is spreading around the globe. Imaan, Yaqeen, thoughts of Hereafter, Farz, Sunnahs, Waajib and Mustahab- all are penetrating each and every individuals life, which were never seen before. The only point for us to understand and know is how much is my contribution towards this noble and wonderful work. </p>
