                        <p>If a person enjoys the Blessings of Allah Ta‘ala, but does not obey Him, Allah Ta’ala puts a veil on his intellect and Wisdom. Allah does not let good ideas come to his mind. When Allah Ta‘ala wants to punish and destroy somebody, lust and prohibited desires engulf his heart. As a result, the person ends up destroying himself. No one can deceive Allah Ta’ala. He is “All Wise” and “All Knowing”. Allah will not communicate with you directly. He will send signals via the materialistic world and by receiving those signals we must act according to His Wishes - just as we follow traffic signals. Have you ever heard the traffic signals speak? Of course not! Your actions must be in accordance to those signals. You must also closely monitor the world and recognize Allah's Wishes. If and when you do that, your actions will be full of Ikhlas (Pleasing to Allah).General law of Allah: he sends small small problems to warn us, change our path, fear Him or carry out repentance and our overall reformation failing to which bigger problems strike. Intelligent people understand this secret and act accordingly Make sure that Satan does not trick you into believing that it's in accord with Allah's wishes. Once one of the Companion of Prophet PBUH said “When my wife and horses act disobediently I do not try to please them I try to please Allah because it is Allah SWT who has penetrated hatred to their heart so I try to please Him”. If you notice someone is disobedient to Allah but receiving worldly gifts and comforts this is a dangerous trap, anytime the person can be severely punished by Allah, much like rat cage. </p>
