                        <p>Those who suffers multiple health hazards during their young age they are the worst victims of health suffering later on their life. Those who suffer ailments after 60 years of their age they suffer less consequences of ailments then than if young age people , this is my independent observation and opinion as a health consultant for 30 years experience. Try your best not to suffer high BP, diabetes and thyroid at an early age. If your appetite is too low and rarely you are hungry or you don't sleep well, it's an indication that something is not right with your health. You must pay attention and rule out the reason. </p>
