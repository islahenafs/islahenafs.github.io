                        <p>Allah doesn't act in haste but Men (and women) are impatient by nature. Whatever happens in front of their eyes take huge toll on their mind and soul. On the spur they start reacting and commit such actions which often result in regret. One has to think all his thoughts and perform all his actions in accordance with the Commands of Allah (Quran) and Sunnah, otherwise wrong and inaccurate deeds will be reflected from his body which will multiply his sufferings and bring misery. May Allah grant me that intellect and Wisdom so that I can scan through all my thoughts and vasvasa then analyse their consequences and take decision to accept the good hidden within it and reject the bad. Ameen! </p>
