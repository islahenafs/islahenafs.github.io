                        <p>Learn your limitations. Don't exceed the limit in any matter, whether it is related to worldly affairs or religion. In all spheres, we should try and keep a balanced approach (aitadaal). We should apply discretion while meeting and talking to people over phone. In these times people are facing lot of problems and precarious conditions. Hence, they will unabashedly make you listen to their problems, which will enthuse negative energy into your mind. Now, if you receive ten such calls ona daily basis, there would be a thousand problems choked up in your mind making it a hub of negative energies. Hence, keep such meetings and interactions to a minimum.</p>
