                        <p>There are few people who encourage others, but there are many more who try to bring others down by discouraging them or by finding faults in them. This can cause many to fail and they stop making efforts to succeed. Acoach who encourages the team enables the team to have a winning attitude. One should not be upset about small discomfort, think that Allah is protecting you from larger problems, otherwise also no problem is going to stay forever it will be disappeared sooner or later. So don't be hopeless and frightened, read 'Alam Nash-rah laka' Surah from Quran, Allaah will short out your problem very soon Insha- Allah. Once Hazrat Ali Radhi Allaha anhu said “ Oh Allah , when I lose my hopes and plans, help me remember that your love is greater than my disappointments, and your plans for my life are better than my dreams.” Difficult roads often lead to beautiful destinations. </p>
