                        <p>No messenger will come after Prophet Mohammad PBUH. Hence, Dawaah is granted to the Ummah. We are accountable of our religion in a manner similar to how we are accountable for our family. If we do not work hard to spread good in the world, bad will engulf us, which is clearly visible these days. Once we are out in the path of Allah and we travel to various places for Dawaah we will come across the present conditions of the Ummah. How pathetic and painful is their condition and they are suffering because they are unaware of the righteous path of the Deen. </p>
