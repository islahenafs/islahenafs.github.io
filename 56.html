                        <p>When we invoke people to perform Dawaah we must make them understand that they should avoid bad habits such as: excess eating, talking and sleeping, smoking, chewing tobacco and betel leaves (Paan). Satan will try to inculcate these bad habits in our system. But, Insha Allah, at the same time the work of Dawaah provides all of us opportunities and strength to get away from these bad habits. You are out in the path of Allah to suppress your own Nafs not others. Sincerely, silently and willing accept this bitter truth. Iam concerned that Satan might make you a slave of your own Nafs by following its orders all the time. Remember-many people are worshiping their Nafs not Allah, when they return home they enter with a huge and powerful Nafs. They have been eaten well, slept much, spoken more and spent according to their desired of their Nafs not Allah's Command. suppressing your Nafs is the hidden secret of Deen and a beauty of Islam which we are neglecting these days. May Allah help us to do it comfortably. (Afieth Asani) </p>
