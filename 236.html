                        <p>There is no way out for a Muslim except to follow the way of Imaan, do good deeds and the work of Dawaah. Our ancestors have been repeating this for years. Because the qualities we need to develop may not develop at home. Allah SWT said, “Oh! My people, you may desire something and so do I, if your desire becomes my desire, I will do accordingly. But if it's only your wishes that you are following and fulfilling, then I will do as per My Wish, which will be against your wishes and might destroyed you!” </p>
