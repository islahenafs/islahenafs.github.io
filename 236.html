                        <p>I have written this book to protect myself and others from the deception of the materialistic world and to get benefits out of it (materialistic world) by adopting the right principles. But my fear is that it should not make people to take advantage of only Duniya. Basically, non-believers do not understand the secret of the present world. All they understand is that Duniya is for themselves and nothing else. Today's Muslims have also become materialistic. They only know how to draw benefits from others, nothing else, by telling lies and following illegal means to do things. They neither understand the consequences of Duniya, nor that of Hereafter. They are not bothered about the Commands of Allah or death, graveyard, Heaven and Hell. They think they are not accountable to Allah. Not only are they doing it themselves but are also making their children slaves of Duniya. May Allah save as from such ideas and miseries. Allah does not keep love for the materialistic world and that is what He wants us to follow all the time in life and imbibe the same teachings in our children. Remember one thing, those who are the slaves of Aakhirah, Allah will reward them in plenty (Barakah), but those who only wish for worldly pleasures now, Allah might reward them with some of the comforts and luxuries, but they will not get any benefit in the Hereafter, because their target was only Duniya. There's a famous saying, “People cannot get more than what they are destined to receive”. </p>
