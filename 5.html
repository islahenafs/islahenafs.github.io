                        <p>We need to inculcate two habits while we are out in the path of Allah for Dawaah. First is to Worship Allah. Second is to perform good deeds, which pleases Allah. Whosoever keeps himself busy in such activities and safeguards himself from the evil talks and deeds will be blessed in this world and Hereafter. This book “Learn to swim before you sink”, Insha- Allah shall teach us as how it is possible. </p>
