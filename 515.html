                        <p>knowledge for successful execution and fulfilling priorities, responsibilities and rights with sincerity and dedication. Forgive people, control five senses, try to keep your heart clean, transparent and free of ill feelings about others. May Allah protect us from the adversities of brawls, quarrels, anger, torture and conflict! Do tauba and astagfar so He may distance the ill feelings away. Those who do not understand the importance of priorities will suffer throughout life, the most. State the problem first and amicably find its’ solution. So meticulously plan and perform well (Aamaal). Correct decision and timely right action will save you from all chaos, If decision making involves emotions, anger and haste - they will be wrong decisions. The right ones are made with a rational mind and an understanding of the situation. Never forget the “Test of Allah”. If you follow these guidelines I am sure Allah will provide you Peace and help. </p>
