                        <p>Nowadays people want to fulfill their desires irrespective of concern about whether this would hurt others or not. Such people do not consider another person's sentiment, compulsion and situation. People remove their employees in fits of anger. People have to learn restraint, patience and sacrifice to achieve peace of mind. It is a fact that whatever happens in this world happens as what Allah wills. There is a fixed duration and time for everything to happen. Nothing can happen before the destined time. One should always be mindful of Allah's will in the work he/she strives for. </p>
