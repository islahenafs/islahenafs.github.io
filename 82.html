                        <p>Many people do not have the strength to bear the stress of severe medical conditions arising in the family. They are unable to bear the brunt of incidents and situations that arise in the family due to brain hemorrhage, paralysis or heart attack to any member of the family. We should not only look at these accidents, but also look after other family members' condition especially during critical situations I hope you understood what I meant to say. For instance wife suffered stroke but husband could not bear the pain and agony so he suffered heart attack. It generally happens in our society. </p>
