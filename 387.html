                        <p>AN IDEAL FAMILY 89 Many a times, people skip a virtuous act due to being too lazy or deprived of enough spiritual push to carry out these work due to their past sins. This happens due to excessive love of worldly pleasures. One does not become inclined to do any virtuous act without being repentant. We need to pay attention to this. Ignorance and laziness are spiritual ailments which can be cured only if we are reminiscent of our death and fear Allah. </p>
