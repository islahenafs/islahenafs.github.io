                        <p>These people become call themselves Peer O Mursheeds and extract from the devotees a huge sum or reward in the name of Deen. It could be anyone for that matter in any form of business or profession- be it a doctor, engineer, pilot etc. More so it becomes an obsession of innocent simple people to be giving in charity in the name of Allah, as they get hypnotized. It is advisable to first verify their background details before investing your time and money in them. People with weak faith do indulge in such things. When someone wears a topi and has a beard and calls himself Allahwala, then any common and simple man will believe him and in all likelihood be fooled by the appearance. </p>
