                        <p>Knowledge without action can be futile, in which thousands are trapped. Some of them do not even realize it till the ability to do good deeds has been seized from them. It is therefore humbly requested that you plan your daily 24-hour lifestyle. All the priorities should be given a fixed time, else nothing will be done perfectly and time will be wasted. It is important to note that whenever you do any job Satan will instill non-priority subjects in your mind and restrain you from doing the priority work. Satan is our greatest enemy, his tricks are innumerable, for example we feel Ghaflah (laziness) most of the time during action, performance and Ibadah. One of the tricks he tries is habituating one to luxuries, addicting one to tobacco and pleasures and making one eat excess food, so that the person becomes lethargic and sleepy all the time, lack of vigour and energy plague him and weaknesses surround him, so that he is not able to perform well. </p>
