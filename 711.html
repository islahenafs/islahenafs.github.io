                        <p>Once a ship sailed from the American coast for Africa. It was still in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean when it was hit by a severe storm. The ship began to shake violently. All the passengers panicked. They began running hither and thither. It seemed that the ship would sink at any moment.</p><p>In this hour of crisis one of the passengers caught sight of a child in a corner of the ship, playing with her doll. The passenger asked the child: 'Do you know what is going to happen?” The child asked in all innocence', 'What is the matter?” The Passenger replied:" Our ship has been hit by a storm, and it is going to sink." Continuing to play with her doll, she replied: " you Know, my father is the captain of the ship. He is not going to let it sink.” </p><p>This incident gives us a picture of a truly spiritual person. A truly spiritual person never falls prey to frustration. He does not become overwrought in times of crisis. He never loses courage. He always lives in hope. In every situation, he is in a position to say: </p><p>"Allah Almighty is the captain of my ship. He is not going to let it sink.” </p>
