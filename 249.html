                        <p>One who wants to be reformed undergoes reformation. I always blame myself that I am responsible for all my sufferings. </p><p>I was unable to decide during the hour of decision making. </p><p>I could not perform well during the time of optimum performance. </p><p>I have accepted those things (Nafs), in which sufferings and losses were hidden. </p><p>I was trapped in my own thoughts. </p><p>If Allah does not send correct thoughts to my mind what will I do? </p><p>If Allah does not provide me the ability (Taufiq) and opportunity to perform good deeds, how would I do? </p><p>If Allah does not provide me means (Asbab) where will I fetch it from? </p><p>Finally, if I am lazy towards fulfilling my duties and responsibilities, how would I ever become an achiever? </p>
