                        <p>It is necessary to provide comfort to mind and heart if one feels tired after working hard for the cause of Dawaah. Ponder that you are a sinful man and repent for past sins by asking for forgiveness from Allah SWT. Also consider that you know nothing as whoever considers himself a humble person will be at an advantageous position. Make sure that your mind does not divert to various useless subjects, if it happens then the mind will be overburdened. Just stop thinking, control and ignore thoughts, relax and try to filter the mind at this situation. Pray to Allah SWT for giving you a stress-free life, without any ailment, poverty, sorrow and ultimate destruction. For more relaxation and stress-free life, it is recommended that you exercise and travel, when possible, to de-stress and remove unnecessary worries and tensions. It really helps. Take deep tissue and head massage as it is very useful. If you suffer pain in the right side of your body it means you are working very hard without taking proper rest known as physical stress and if it is on the left side of your body it indicates that you are suffering from emotional stress. </p>
