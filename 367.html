                        <p>I would like to draw your attention to one more key aspect of our life. At times, we need to collect donation/ contribution to carry out many religious and community services/tasks. It is important to be careful while collecting this money and one should not insist too much. If anyone pays against his wish under the pressure of too much insistence then it would be against his wishes and he would be inconvenienced. People do not collect phone calls and start ignoring and avoiding them who keeps insisting. Many institutions send very young students for collection who call out people for contribution. It is not right as this habit of asking for help may get ingrained in their young minds and they become habitual of this trend. A man grows used to do when a task is repeated time and again. People also stop respecting them. It is not good to expect for help from anyone other than the Master of this Universe. This is the sign of weak faith. </p>
