                        <p>“Our Lord! Condemn us not if we forget or fall into error; our Lord! Lay not on us a burden Like that which Thou didst lay on those before us; Our Lord! Lay not on us a burden greater than we have strength to bear. Blot out our sins, and grant us forgiveness. Have mercy on us. Thou art our Protector; Help us against those who stand against faith.” O Allah, Help me save from the entrapments of Satan. O Allah, Keep me steadfast on the path of Sunnah! O Allah, verily I do not know where from I will get my sustenance? Indeed to look for it I lay myself open to possible risks which threaten my heart. I go round in its search to (many) places. O my sustainer, give me abundant sustenance, make easy for me its seeking, let its source be near me and let me not in vain run after the sustenance You have not selected for me, because You do not want to punish me whereas I am always in need of Your mercy. Save me from afflictions! I should neither have stress, nor difficulties. O Allah, forgive me those sins which tear apart safeguards! O Allah, forgive me those sins which draw down adversities! O Allah, forgive me every sin I have committed and every mistake I have made! O Allah, help me carry out my commitments and my responsibilities viz. my responsibilities towards my parents, my family, my neighbours, my subordinates. O Allah, verily I seek nearness to You through remembrance of You, And I seek intercession from You with Yourself”. - Ameen. </p>
