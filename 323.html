                        <p>There is a hadith that whoever speaks truth has got salvation and a liar is always doomed. I feel the current issue in the world is because of this only as people are not adhering to the virtues of truth. People speak lies to avoid the awkward moments. People may get reprieve temporarily then but later on when other people realize then they get disillusioned. </p>
