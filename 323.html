                        <p>A person does not only communicate through his tongue, but also through his body. This is called body language. A few people do not pay attention to this. Many people are afflicted with mood swings which may be due to some disease like thyroid or high blood pressure. When such people enter the house, then it appears as if they are coming from a cemetery. One should always have a cheerful disposition. It's a great blessing. This is one of the Sunnah of our Prophet (peace be upon him). When I was in London, I noticed that people were always serious. Maybe this was due to the workload, lifestyle or inflation. It is not right to be like this always as it may led to depression. </p>
