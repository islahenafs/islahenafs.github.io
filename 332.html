                        <p>I want to draw your attention on two very important things and they are good deed and actions. Everything is useless if you do not commit right deeds. When our Prophet (PBUH) was going for Meraaj with archangel Gabriel then he sws saw a certain things going up and something is coming down. He sws asked upfront form Gabriel as what are they. He replied the ones which are going up are the deeds of your Ummah and the one which are coming down are the outcomes in accordance to that. If one has done good deeds then he/she is blessed and if one has committed a wrong deed then the outcome is also according to that. </p>
