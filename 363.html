                        <p>Due to stress related ailments such as high blood pressure, sugar, thyroid, frustration or short temper, bad nature or addiction, a kind of pressure and stress develops in the mind. Now when the illiterate and arrogant people act or talk inappropriately or foolishly, it gets absorbed through senses in the mind which multiplies the tension in the brain. It is because of this multiplication one starts behaving rudely and harshly to the extent of even causing physical abuse, torture etc. The only solution to this apathetic condition is- forgive people and increase your threshold of tolerance and instead become a peace loving man. Once you develop these qualities you will inadvertently achieve peace. For you cannot change them it is better you change your attitude. I often say the intellectual's greatest threat Is the illiterate. </p>
