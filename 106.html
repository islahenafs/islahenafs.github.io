                        <p>Do not overburden other people with your problems. People who have regards for you, will try and satisfy your needs, but in that process they might lose a lot in terms of time and energy, which could cause harm: their health, work and personal life. We notice that our subordinates are oppressed very often. If you put people in trouble for no reason, you will also get into troubles in life. If Allah Taâ€˜ala dislikes something, soon or later, He teaches a lesson. </p>
