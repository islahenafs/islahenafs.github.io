                        <p>There is nothing in this world that can trouble you more than your thoughts if you don't think appropriately. To be honest with you, thinking correctly is designed only for intellectuals and experienced professionals; common people obey whatever their elders commands because of low levels of intellect and lack of experience. If they try to follow own mind, Satan will just misguide them and sufferings will multiply. At times excess thoughts give huge burden to the mind and the thoughts become out of control, it is imperative to keep the mind calm and peaceful. Living a lonely life and not talk at all, try and stop thinking. Protect senses. If one does not do that and repeatedly face this problem one might become a mental wreck and it might lead to psychological and neurological disorders. </p>
