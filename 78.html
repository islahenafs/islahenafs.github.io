                        <p>Everyone wants to achieve the peak of health, but very few are fortunate enough to. The body is a heavily complex machine and maintaining perfection of it is definitely a difficult task. Imagine its complexity, as scientists put it-- combine the entire worlds computers and multiply them by 100 (in terms of their programming and detail) and then you may be close to 10% DNA of Human body. With such a high level of complexity the task of achieving ultimate health becomes all the more difficult and therefore extremely careful measures must be employed for its optimal performance. One perfect health is equivalent to 1000 bounties, so one has to sacrifice 1000 things to get perfect health. But we want is to indulge in excessive pleasures and have perfect health at the same time. Such a thing is impossible, as to attain perfect health one must follow a regulated and strict lifestyle. </p>
