                        <p>A person who safeguards his senses from false thoughts and olden day's memories can control his tongue more effectively. These things can affect human senses because the mind is connected with the tongue. Sometimes, we observe that one starts foul mouthing when one notices other people's errors and shortcomings. If one repeats the same thing repeatedly one may develop a habit of doing that quite often. When something happens against one's wishes or desires, we immediately retort in an ungainly manner. One should try and control this and stop being judgmental about others. One should take care of ones’ thoughts when one is alone and take care of ones’ words when one is with others. It is strange that “sword” and “words” have the same alphabets and it is even more strange that they have the same effect if not handled properly. One should not get addicted to social media like face book and WhatsApp as these are creating additional stress & pressures by burdening the mind and heart. Even during midnight people have strong urge to check their phones and respond. This habit should be curbed. </p>
