                        <p>Its often seen that leaders and influential people base their decisions and opinions on the views of their close confidants without actually independently understanding it. Also, there are times you need expert opinion on a matter thats personal, but in the fear of the matter being shared with the family and relative of the expert you refrain from asking and no longer reap the benefit of his/her intellect and wisdom. </p>
