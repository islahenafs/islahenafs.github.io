                        <p>On the day of Judgement, the ill mannered and the ones with pride will be thrown in the fire of Hell solely for their anger and wrong attitude. They have dampened their relations with others and fallen in the eyes of Allah. Pride is the climax of ego and arrogance. They were perpetrators of injustice and excessiveness. Intellect evaporates because of anger and also makes one forget consequences of the same. There is no control over what one says during anger, which is the climax of ego. When angry, refrain from hurting the other person through words or deeds. For, the wounds take a long time to heal. To be kind is more important than to be right. Many times what people need is not a brilliant mind that speaks but a kind heart that listens. Often it is seen that a person with weak Imaan ‘disconnects’ with Allah Ta’ala due to the hardships faced in life, as his faith dwindles. He then becomes frustrated without reason and starts spoiling his relationships with others by way of quarreling and fighting. When someone acts as a brute, a rude person and uses violence upon someone, he forgets that its not only one person upon whom the misbehaviour is inflicted but that act hurts more people attached to him. This is true for both sides- the inflictor and inflicted. Most heart related conditions such as thyroid, high blood pressure, kidney ailments and liver issues are linked with anger in most patients. Humility develops when efforts are made towards building a moral character. May Allah bless us with this kind of behaviour. When there is a lot of grief in the heart and the mind is stressed out, watch out; for it can result in cerebral accidents as strokes. Adopt a gentle tone when speaking, because, at times, the tone has a greater impact than the speech. Please beware, be cautioned that Allah Ta’ala's angels are noting all our words, actions, intentions and all these will be accounted for on the Day of Judgment. O Allah“if I hurt others, give me the strength to apologize, if people hurt me, give me the strength to forgive”. Ameen. When you face two imbeciles at such dismay. Abandon such a scene for it may physically harm you and cause damage - getting inflicted by a stone or even suffer a knife attack. </p>
