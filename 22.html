                        <p>Another narration from the Hadith I wish to mention, â€œOnce, one of the Sahabah was dying and was unable to read Kalimah. The message reached Prophet SAW and so he went to him and enquired into the matter, Huzur SAW came to know that the Sahabah's mother was unhappy with her son. So, Huzur SAW requested his mother to forgive him. When the mother forgave her son, the son recited the Kalimah and left peacefully for his final journey. </p>
