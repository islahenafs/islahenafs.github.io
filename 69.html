                        <p>When you do something repeatedly you will become habitual of it. For example, if you smoke a cigarette or chew a paan in the company of your friends for some days, you are bound to become habitual of these activities. It's a fact that whatever you do or think repeatedly, you will acquire that addiction. Hence, always act with caution and stay away from bad habits. </p>
