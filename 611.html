                        <p>I am sharing an example with all of you, one in which I was deceived and took it as a learning experience. I was told “Arif is waiting outside”, my sudden thought was of my old much close friend of mine waiting. I stepped outside only to realize that it's not my old buddy but my printing person, Arif waiting. I wonder why it so happened. </p>
