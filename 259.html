                        <p>Ask yourself and your children whether they just dream or do something like Companions of Prophet PBUH (Sahabah). If it is mere dream the life will pass thinking. I often suggest to my children these things, remember Allah in silence and calmness, remain focus towards duties and responsibilities then perform them through Sunnah; this way neither are neglected, practice self control, so that you don't commit any evil. World is a place of deceptions, displeasures and filled with Satan's trap so have knowledge and patience to counter them. </p>
