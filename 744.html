                        <p>Allah has made the human body weaker in comparison with many of His Creations. Many a times a person remains unwell or tired yet his Nafs keep him engaged and_ forces him to fulfill his worldly desires. He may be undergoing tremendous stress or general weakness or lacking in physical strength to bear outcomes of fulfilment of his desires. In this situation if a person follows his Nafs blindly, he will terribly fall sick. </p>
