                        <p>We should live life in a way that nobody raises a finger at us. It is said that you have to be before people as you would be before the Almighty. When people meet us they should be impressed by our good behavior. They should take with them a good image of ours. Please remember that your attitude will determine your altitude. I have spent nearly 320 days (eight chilla's) with Syed Yusuf Ali who was my Ameer e Jamat and the chief of railways of Tableeghi- Jamat, I dined with him, sat beside him and closely observed him throughout the day. I must admit I failed to have found a single short coming. I think it's that level of effort he has put in to perfectly reform himself. What I have seen in his character that he never pin pointed others faults, whatever he wanted to reform or change he used to say to Allaah SWT but remained as a model character man with a perfect example. There are two ways of spreading light : to be the candle or mirror that reflect it. </p>
