                        <p>In general when the heart and mind are pressurised by changing weather, irregular parameters, lack of sleep or by excess of entertainment, addiction, exercise, food, stress, grief and emotion one might suffer ailments such as high blood pressure, a heart attack or stroke or both. This can also happens if one does not closely monitor the internal rhythm of his body. For a Muslim, pressure builds in mind and heart once the heart lacks Noor-e-Imaan and a strong relationship with Allah, right from its core. Food cravings and anger are dangerous for heart. Make sure at all times softness and kindness is surrounding your heart. Its fragrance heals faster. On the other hand, hardness and harshness are evil - and the root cause to many ailments. </p>
