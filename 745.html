                        <p>Do not keep the burden of speech, words and sentences in your head, rather keep the load of your daily works, responsibilities and priorities. Without performance nothing can be achieved. Each act should be done with utmost sincerity (Ikhlas) such as work of Dawah, diet, exercises and earning Halal livelihood. While doing them, do not follow your desires (Nafsani khawhish) and protect yourself from deception otherwise life will become difficult. Make sure that during performance you are fully focused to the present subject and must take proper rest after working hard for your priorities to avoid stress. </p>
