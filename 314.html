                        <p>I often instruct my sons, Ahmed Hasan Ali and Noorul Hasan Ali, who are the editors of this book that they should not overlook the Commandments of Allah while chasing the worldly commitments. If you do so then you would never be able to achieve them as there would be obstacle in doing so. Allah is aware that you have ignored His words and orders while chasing your worldly goals. Truly Allah knows everything. </p>
