                            <div id = 'quotes'><div class='quote' id=1><p>In a time of universal deceit, telling the truth is a revolutionary act</p></div><div class='quote' id=10><p>The world needs to understand that Islam is not against luxuries, nor does it believe in denying anyone the enjoyment of a quality life. Allah has provided us with His Blessings in the form of wealth and other worldly pleasures. However, along with it, He has also laid down terms on how to enjoy bliss. </p></div><div class='quote' id=100><p>Recognizing people, understanding situations and reacting in time are very important aspects of life. We must not take wrong steps by being misled by Satan, otherwise we will have to repent and pay a heavy price. It is a wise decision to treat people at par with their ability and capability. </p></div><div class='quote' id=101><p>A man does not become rich by being pious. However, Allah fills his heart with benevolence by Bestowing Blessings upon him. </p></div><div class='quote' id=102><p>We have to face a lot of problems if our wife and children are not obedient. In such a situation we should be patient and tolerant towards them. They should provide comfort and keep the harmonious relation in the family but sometimes because of being misled by Satan they may cause trouble in the family. </p></div><div class='quote' id=103><p>When a child matures and becomes an adult, we should involve them in activities and seek their advice in appropriate matters. But if we do not indulge them and inculcate a feeling of bonding and teach them the advantages of a closely-knit family, they are bound to go astray and will not have the feeling of “oneness” and ultimately may become acause of trouble to the family. </p></div><div class='quote' id=104><p>Learn your limitations. Don't exceed the limit in any matter, whether it is related to worldly affairs or religion. In all spheres, we should try and keep a balanced approach (aitadaal). We should apply discretion while meeting and talking to people over phone. In these times people are facing lot of problems and precarious conditions. Hence, they will unabashedly make you listen to their problems, which will enthuse negative energy into your mind. Now, if you receive ten such calls ona daily basis, there would be a thousand problems choked up in your mind making it a hub of negative energies. Hence, keep such meetings and interactions to a minimum.</p></div><div class='quote' id=105><p>There is nothing in this world that can trouble you more than your thoughts if you don't think appropriately. To be honest with you, thinking correctly is designed only for intellectuals and experienced professionals; common people obey whatever their elders commands because of low levels of intellect and lack of experience. If they try to follow own mind, Satan will just misguide them and sufferings will multiply. At times excess thoughts give huge burden to the mind and the thoughts become out of control, it is imperative to keep the mind calm and peaceful. Living a lonely life and not talk at all, try and stop thinking. Protect senses. If one does not do that and repeatedly face this problem one might become a mental wreck and it might lead to psychological and neurological disorders. </p></div><div class='quote' id=106><p>Do not overburden other people with your problems. People who have regards for you, will try and satisfy your needs, but in that process they might lose a lot in terms of time and energy, which could cause harm: their health, work and personal life. We notice that our subordinates are oppressed very often. If you put people in trouble for no reason, you will also get into troubles in life. If Allah Ta‘ala dislikes something, soon or later, He teaches a lesson. </p></div><div class='quote' id=107><p>Every desire is a burden on man. Even though something is not in our destiny, it seeps into our mind, and we crave for it. And it is often observed that usually things, which are harmful for us, are desired the most. That is why the Prophet (PBUH) prohibits the Ummah from lusting for materialistic things blindly. </p></div><div class='quote' id=108><p>Everybody has flaws that must be recognized and rooted out. For example, if someone is highly stressed and in the process ends up taking wrong decisions he is bound to get trapped sooner or later. This happens; in spite of him being pious. </p></div><div class='quote' id=109><p>There are few people who encourage others, but there are many more who try to bring others down by discouraging them or by finding faults in them. This can cause many to fail and they stop making efforts to succeed. Acoach who encourages the team enables the team to have a winning attitude. One should not be upset about small discomfort, think that Allah is protecting you from larger problems, otherwise also no problem is going to stay forever it will be disappeared sooner or later. So don't be hopeless and frightened, read 'Alam Nash-rah laka' Surah from Quran, Allaah will short out your problem very soon Insha- Allah. Once Hazrat Ali Radhi Allaha anhu said “ Oh Allah , when I lose my hopes and plans, help me remember that your love is greater than my disappointments, and your plans for my life are better than my dreams.” Difficult roads often lead to beautiful destinations. </p></div><div class='quote' id=11><p>Unfortunately, some people, for the sake of defaming Islam, assert that Islam is a religion that enhances poverty and problems, which is not true. The fact is, problems arise due to not obeying Allah and not following the path of the Prophet (PBUH). The success Herein and Hereafter lies in abiding by Allah and the Prophet (PBUH). </p></div><div class='quote' id=110><p>Do not keep your children and spouse away from yourself or keep them unaware of the knowledge of Deen. Always teach them to be pious and religious just as you are supposed to be. Pray for them too. Try to make them a performers, a master strategists and efficient performers within the boundaries of Deen of Islam. If they remain ignorant of good deeds they will indulge in wrongful acts and on the day of the judgment they will hold you responsible. In this process you will also invite Allah Ta’ala's wrath. </p></div><div class='quote' id=111><p>If a child obeys his parents and teachers and serves willingly and obediently, he will attain good heights in life and Hereafter by way of their blessings and prayers. The blessings and prayers of parents and teachers are very beneficial and important for success in life. But, most children do not understand this. They neither respect their parents, nor teachers and therefore go through sufferings in life. After Allah and Prophet (PBUH) the most important gift of this world is the patents, earn their Dua and love as much as you can, you are fortunate if you are having both of them. Ask those who have lost them. Be obedient to them, serve them as your priorities, and treat their commands as Allah's Commands. Hell and Heaven lies at their feet. Never act against their wishes. “My Lord! Bestow on them thy Mercy even as they cherished me in childhood” Al Quran. </p></div><div class='quote' id=112><p>A friend of my wife once rightly mentioned that we must keep our children in a competitive and healthy environment - an environment where their capabilities can be utilized to the optimum level and they are encouraged to achieve greater heights in life. Otherwise, their capabilities will be trapped in negative things and they will suffer losses and failure in life. </p></div><div class='quote' id=113><p>Often, in married life Satan gets into the mind of one of the partner and makes him pinpoint the negative aspects of the other person's character. This causes friction between them and the rift between the two widens with time. Instead the partners should see the strengths and good points of each other and prosper together. By only seeing negatives and finding faults in a person, one may not analyse a situation correctly which can cause negative impact in a relationship. Once I joked with my wife by saying, “All the men would have landed in Paradise if there weren't any women in this world”, she replied, “The very existence of men would not have been in this planet without us (women).” A relationship made out of fear of Allah does not need promises, terms and conditions- it just needs two wonderful people.” </p></div><div class='quote' id=114><p>By the grace of Allah Ta‘ala spouse is a great gift from Allah Ta'ala. We should understand their weaknesses and without finding faults and taunting them, must forgive them and treat them with love and affection. We must try to lighten the burden of our wives by sharing responsibilities. A woman is an asset and a blessing for the entire family. Through your spouse Allah Ta‘ala has arranged a situation of comfort and blessings for you and your children. These are the teachings of the Prophet (PBUH). He has also advised the Ummah to forgive and treat the women of the house with respect and dignity. Women are a mystery and nobody really knows what is going on in their brain except Allah. It's noted their brain is busy multi tasking. Yes, there are times they act child-like, other times like a princess, at times as a dictator and sometimes like Hazrat Rabia Bashri RA, so it is really hard to handle them without alteration in your ways. </p></div><div class='quote' id=115><p>If the nature of the spouse is compatible, it is one of the greatest Blessings of Allah Ta‘ala. However, if the nature of the wife is not as per the nature and liking of the husband then life can become big misery for the entire family. Wife should understand that her husband's will should be of prime importance to her and she should not take any step against his will. Similarly the husband should also consider her suggestions. He should also keep in mind that his wife should not be displeased with his poor attitude and bad behavior. Always remember that Allah Ta‘ala has bestowed the wife in the shelter of her husband and his family. So, by no means should the husband and his family cause worry, misery or agony to the woman. For, a woman leaves her home to be accepted by your family and she should be treated and respected as other members of your family. </p></div><div class='quote' id=116><p>The wife is a blessing of Allah Ta‘ala till the time she fulfills her responsibilities as per the will of the husband. But, at times, due to her ignorance she may become a cause of worry to the husband. However, the wife may not realize this. That is why she does not seek forgiveness. Having struggled throughout the day at work, a husband wants to relax when he enters the comfort zone created by his wife. But, he is agonized on reaching home, as he finds his wife's behavior is inappropriate. This can result in him reacting in a harsh manner that can further cause family discord. All this leads to friction, frustration, anxiety and, inadvertently, mishaps happen in such situations. May Allah Ta’ala save all of us from this kind of agony and misery! Some people say that it is necessary to abandon all worldly pleasure to become a pious person. And we all know that a woman is one of the charms of the world. A person who compromises with his wife in an undue and unjust manner, loses his self-respect and also the respect in front of the Almighty. Allah forbid if you come across a woman of bad character and poor temperament, then pray to Allah Ta’ala for bestowing Wisdom upon you. Stay away from such women in all circumstances, as they can bring harm to you. Also, remain cautious in getting your children married, because majority of people are cheated in this matter. While getting our children married we should keep in mind the religion, family, all physical attributes, nature, wealth, education, beauty, language and culture. We must carefully find out the family's source of income and in which livelihood the boy and the girl have been brought up. Good family generation are like blood, which flows like blood in the body ,generation to generation. Basically marriages are not between girl and boys rather it is between two families, so before finalising marriages, make sure that both the family's attitude (Mizaaj) is equal. There are strong possibilities of friction if the spouses families are not compatible. The marriage is an essential part of Islam. Hence, we should take due precautions in this matter. As they say that husband and wife are like two wheels of the same vehicle called a family. Unwanted or a failed marriage is not like a piece of a furniture of the house which may be exchanged later. Marriage makes a chain of generations. Hence, selection of spouse should be done with utmost care. Doing The Istikhara (a kind of prayer where divine intervention is required from Allah Ta'ala) is suggested, must be done again and again to clear all doubts and mysteries that prevail. It is to be remembered that all the qualities described above, cannot be found in one person. Hence, religion must be preferred first (Haya, Sharam Taqwa, Taharat,Deendari, Parhez gari etc) so as the vehicle of the life may be driven peacefully. Without Deen animalistic behavior rides on human, how will you handle your spouse without Deen? Allah forbid, if your life partner is not good, then pray to Allah Ta'ala for him/her to reform. This will reward you and Allah will correct him/her. In order to reform the Nafs of a Man, Wives serve as a great hammering tool. They would say things that make no absolute sense, do things the wrong way, act in a certain way etc. But this reforms the Nafs of a Man. </p><p>The husband should remember that his wife has given him the best part of her life the youth, devotes a very large part of her life to him and family. So he should always be kind to her. In these modern times of information technology there is another menace which has cropped up. The social networking sites carry certain statements by people which are used as evidences and statements which may carry a personal grudge. We all know that these days development in information communication technology (ICT) has created new ways for everyone to interact and conduct business. There is no doubt that Internet is one of the most popular mediums of communication in cyber environment. However, this medium is also creating opportunities for people to commit various types of offences and wrong doings. The offences include divorce or talaaq. The discord between couples is aggravated to the point of “no return” and hence couples decide to part ways. It is important to understand and remember even in times of discord that the words may be deleted from your personal device but stay in the device of the recipient. Satan is happy when the marriage breaks because this way the relationship between a number of people is broken between two families. Many Muslim women have been highly influenced by Western culture so they have adopted their life style in terms of dressing, eating, educating, living according to them; not only this they are also proud of it. Now what is happening -our children are also adopting their culture, In return children are becoming disobedient, but I want to mention here divorces are becoming common these days just as these extremely common in Europe and America, even in Middle East too. The moment women give up on the path of respect and obedience towards husband, the road toward misunderstanding strengthens. Once I asked Hazrat Maulana Zubair sahib (Rehm..),” What kind of girl one should marry?” He replied in these simple words, “The girl who looks after the household, husband, children and relatives very well.” To be honest maximum chaos occurs when the girl neglects these issues, at the same time we love those girls who perform these duties sincerely. Another question I asked him how many wives one should have at a time? He replied have one, with whom you live a peaceful life. </p></div><div class='quote' id=117><p>Allah-fearing men should be cautious of some women (na mehram). Men are biologically programmed to lust for women. Hence, due to being misled by Satan the Wisdom of a man goes for a toss and he gives in to unholy desires. Meeting them on the sly, without the knowledge of the family, or traveling with them, thinking about them or chatting over the phone on WhatsApp and Facebook should be avoided with na mehram women. Whoever does so will be misled by Satan and Satan will enthuse forbidden (haraam) desires in their mind. As a result they will not only spoil their life and duniya but the Hereafter as well. The degree of loss of that misguided person is best known to Allah Ta’ala only. The Satan tries to trap a person by misleading that his lust is love and is justified, but remember that Satan is misguiding him. </p></div><div class='quote' id=118><p>The things, which bring us satisfaction, bliss and peace may be adopted, provided they are permitted (halaal). But at the same time be wary that we do not become addictive to these things. </p></div><div class='quote' id=119><p>Do not associate yourself with an immature person because he may not understand your position. That person may harm you and possibly even take undue advantage of your position. He may also (unintentionally) put you in trouble. If you associate yourself with a mature and righteous person, it will be mutually beneficial. </p></div><div class='quote' id=12><p>Allah wants his people to be successful. But instead of following His path, we search for success where it is not present. Success lies in abiding by the rules of Allah, following the foot step of the Prophet (PBUH) and performing good deeds and living according to Islamic teachings. </p></div><div class='quote' id=120><p>My teacher used to say that if something is done with conviction it would bear fruits. I often say that if you select a right path for your children it will be certainly beneficial for you and them. Allah will shower His Mercy and Blessings as long as they are honest and remain in the straight path. </p></div><div class='quote' id=121><p>It has been observed that men cannot survive without permitted desires and pleasures. But they often cross the limit and indulge in prohibited acts to attain pleasure and thereby commit sin. Hence such men reach the gates of destruction. The Islamic laws and Sharia is formatted in such a way that one must succeed in life and Hereafter by adhering to the laws and principles of Sharia. </p></div><div class='quote' id=122><p>While performing an activity it is important to concentrate on that particular work and one should not digress. One should not bother about too many things otherwise he will be confused. One should concentrate on the work one has started and do it with full confidence. Also it is necessary to take proper rest and sleep because mind is supposed to do important activities. If the mind is tired and exhausted then it will not work properly. </p></div><div class='quote' id=123><p>We should live life in a way that nobody raises a finger at us. It is said that you have to be before people as you would be before the Almighty. When people meet us they should be impressed by our good behavior. They should take with them a good image of ours. Please remember that your attitude will determine your altitude. I have spent nearly 320 days (eight chilla's) with Syed Yusuf Ali who was my Ameer e Jamat and the chief of railways of Tableeghi- Jamat, I dined with him, sat beside him and closely observed him throughout the day. I must admit I failed to have found a single short coming. I think it's that level of effort he has put in to perfectly reform himself. What I have seen in his character that he never pin pointed others faults, whatever he wanted to reform or change he used to say to Allaah SWT but remained as a model character man with a perfect example. There are two ways of spreading light : to be the candle or mirror that reflect it. </p></div><div class='quote' id=124><p>I have always told my children to remember certain things, so that they inculcate those things in their minds and hearts. It is: Do not carry out the order of people by violating the Commands of Allah. Whoever will turn his face from Allah's Command for a while will face the displeasure of Allah for long. </p></div><div class='quote' id=125><p>Many people in the world are like a worm of silk: they are so much trapped in their own world and their own self that they die without anyone caring about them but produced valuable silk. Here, we can cite the example of a candle. It gives light to others and in the process, burns itself. </p></div><div class='quote' id=126><p>If a person enjoys the Blessings of Allah Ta‘ala, but does not obey Him, Allah Ta’ala puts a veil on his intellect and Wisdom. Allah does not let good ideas come to his mind. When Allah Ta‘ala wants to punish and destroy somebody, lust and prohibited desires engulf his heart. As a result, the person ends up destroying himself. No one can deceive Allah Ta’ala. He is “All Wise” and “All Knowing”. Allah will not communicate with you directly. He will send signals via the materialistic world and by receiving those signals we must act according to His Wishes - just as we follow traffic signals. Have you ever heard the traffic signals speak? Of course not! Your actions must be in accordance to those signals. You must also closely monitor the world and recognize Allah's Wishes. If and when you do that, your actions will be full of Ikhlas (Pleasing to Allah).General law of Allah: he sends small small problems to warn us, change our path, fear Him or carry out repentance and our overall reformation failing to which bigger problems strike. Intelligent people understand this secret and act accordingly Make sure that Satan does not trick you into believing that it's in accord with Allah's wishes. Once one of the Companion of Prophet PBUH said “When my wife and horses act disobediently I do not try to please them I try to please Allah because it is Allah SWT who has penetrated hatred to their heart so I try to please Him”. If you notice someone is disobedient to Allah but receiving worldly gifts and comforts this is a dangerous trap, anytime the person can be severely punished by Allah, much like rat cage. </p></div><div class='quote' id=127><p>The easy way to sleep is to lie down according to Sunnah. When the head touches the pillow, do not bother about anything because it will put burden on the mind and you will be sleepless. Moreover, you will waste your time. When you are able to overcome this aspect, you will manage to sleep. As long as you are awake, repeat the name of Allah and seek His Blessings upon the Prophet (Darood). Then you will be able to sleep soon. Sleep is a bounty of nature to comfort human beings. But our stress and thoughts destroy it. The Satan wastes our time and destroys the sleep by bringing unwanted ideas to the mind. </p><p>There are some pain, sufferings and diseases which can be only cured by the grace of Allah through deep sleep and in company of wife such as insomnia, stress and frustration. </p></div><div class='quote' id=128><p>All should strive to save themselves in Aakhirah. Nobody can safeguard anyone. Once the Prophet (PBUH) also told his daughter to strive to do good deeds to save herself from the wrath of fire from Hell. The Prophet (PBUH) advised her that she only could do this to save herself. When the Prophet (PBUH) could suggest this to his own daughter then what to talk of Ummah. </p></div><div class='quote' id=129><p>A huge problem is that when we struggle and strive for something our mind is entangled in the same struggle and thoughts all throughout. Hence we should learn how to switch on and off our mind. </p></div><div class='quote' id=13><p>The world is a place full of problems and anxieties. But we can overcome them all with the help of true knowledge and good deeds. </p></div><div class='quote' id=130><p>May Allah grant us the quality of a steed! We should learn to abide by the rules. We should be capable to move and stop (as the horse acts and stops at the command of the whip and rein). Pious people have to be cautious and watchful of what they are preaching and follow - is it accordance with the Quran and the path of the Prophet (PBUH). This must be always monitored whether during happy or grievous times. May Allah Ta‘ala Bless us all now and forever! May Allah weed out the ill feelings and poor habits of a person. We all face laziness (Ghaflat) during the time of repentance (Tauba) and performance (Aamaal). One must be sincere towards these things. There is no way to penance from punishment of Duniya and Hereafter except Tauba (Repentance). </p></div><div class='quote' id=131><p>If Allah Ta‘ala's wrath descends upon someone his_ worldly affairs will be in severe trouble and would have to suffer huge losses in every way. </p></div><div class='quote' id=132><p>In present time, people are not able to concentrate. Hence they get trapped in lot of problems. Forgetfulness is so common these days. In order to avoid such symptoms one should try and become organized by carrying a paper and a pen with oneself. One should write down the problems and prioritize accordingly. </p></div><div class='quote' id=133><p>The Nafs of some people are so spoilt that they seem highly incorrigible. Sometimes to cure the spoilt soul Allah gives us a displeased condition. Some people do not obey anyone because they become slaves of their own Nafs (Mind). For such people, you should not ruin your mind and bother unnecessarily. Just let them be as they are. </p></div><div class='quote' id=134><p>It is not so easy to rectify or guide some people. If one is angry then he should keep control of his tongue (language). Also, it is very important to keep yourself away from backbiting (gheebah). Whoever does not abide by this, will be punished and his peace in this world and Hereafter will be ruined. </p></div><div class='quote' id=135><p>In these times there are four kinds of evil that are common:</p><p><ol><li>Aggression</li><li>Foul language</li><li>Eating junk food</li><li>Smoking cigarette and chewing gutkha.</li></ol></p><p>All these things must be erased from our system to avoid major crises.</p></div><div class='quote' id=136><p>A person who safeguards his senses from false thoughts and olden day's memories can control his tongue more effectively. These things can affect human senses because the mind is connected with the tongue. Sometimes, we observe that one starts foul mouthing when one notices other people's errors and shortcomings. If one repeats the same thing repeatedly one may develop a habit of doing that quite often. When something happens against one's wishes or desires, we immediately retort in an ungainly manner. One should try and control this and stop being judgmental about others. One should take care of ones’ thoughts when one is alone and take care of ones’ words when one is with others. It is strange that “sword” and “words” have the same alphabets and it is even more strange that they have the same effect if not handled properly. One should not get addicted to social media like face book and WhatsApp as these are creating additional stress & pressures by burdening the mind and heart. Even during midnight people have strong urge to check their phones and respond. This habit should be curbed. </p></div><div class='quote' id=137><p>Everybody may be rectified but not the lazy one. A lazy person just wastes his time in thinking, looking around and bragging about his achievements of the past. He gives advice to others but doesn't apply the same upon himself. He is deprived of action and deeds. There is no synchronization between his words and his actions. Prophet Mohammad PBUH said "The destruction of man lies in three (things): from stomach, lust and tongue." I often say: “Become a performer on the field (action) than orating from the pulpit (Mimbar).” </p></div><div class='quote' id=138><p>Always try and follow the path of the Prophet PBUH. Do not be digressed in different directions. There would be many things around, which you will try and engulf yourself in or they will attract you. So, be strong willed and do not give in to those activities and erroneous thoughts. The important aspect is that you have to practice and perform as per the Sunnah and stay on the righteous path. Remember that actions (Aamaal) decide your fate in the world and Hereafter. Sadly, most people are not aware of this. </p></div><div class='quote' id=139><p>Whoever is entitled to go to Paradise will have the shades of Paradise on himself in this world and whoever is supposed to go to the Hell will have its shades in this world. </p></div><div class='quote' id=14><p>My humble request to humanity is to realize it all before becoming prey to a life of troubles. We must tackle difficult situations as and when they arise and not look for scapegoats and shirk our responsibilities. For, in difficult times, Allah tests our abilities and patience and whosoever sticks to the path suggested by Him, is blessed. </p></div><div class='quote' id=140><p>When apprehensions (vasvasaa) attacks from an unknown direction we are perplexed as it is so complicated to understand. Be aware and cautious of these in your life. </p></div><div class='quote' id=141><p>The deeds (Aamaal) depend upon the intention (niyaah). Good intentions associated with true principles culminate in good results. In order to please Allah Ta'ala keep yourself involved in good deeds and control the lust of live by remaining humble in life. </p></div><div class='quote' id=142><p>Try and keep yourself occupied by being busy in your work and also strive for acceptance of your deeds in front of Allah Ta’ala. </p></div><div class='quote' id=143><p>Whenever your Nafs goes astray and out of control be cautious and warned that your faith is dwindling. This is the time for repentance and astaghfaar. </p></div><div class='quote' id=144><p>The Nafs is best rectified in the company of pious people. Sometimes a person is at the height of being wrong and misguided, but he assumes himself to be righteous. Due to the company and teachings of pious people this illusion is destroyed and he comes back on track and opts for the righteous path. </p></div><div class='quote' id=145><p>Why does anyone surrender himself to a person of Allah (Allah Walah)?</p><p>The company and the grooming of our Prophet Mohammad (PBUH) molded them to such extent (that they are so highly revered) as all of them surrendered themselves to (Prophet) so unconditionally. Companions of our Prophet got rewarded with the title of Radhi Allahu Ta’ala Anhu (May Allah be pleased with them) as they got groomed in his company under his tutelage. In the same way a man surrenders himself to any Allah- Walah (pious) or to a Virtuous man so that his sins are washed off and his weaknesses are removed so that he attains near perfection. His soul gradually gets purified and his connection with Allah is established. </p><p>A farmer harvests his land and a gardener nurtures his orchards so that he can get good crop. Similarly a man becomes virtuous, Allah fearing and guided only by following an Allah- Walah. The grace and grooming of Allah- Walah let the flowers, of love and fear of Allah, bloom one's heart and the person achieves piety. This should be clear to one and all that there is nothing better (in this World) save to be in the company of Allah to seek His love. One has to connect spiritually with an Allah- Walah to establish a bond. This bond or spiritual connection will oversee his soul and protect his heart from the worldly desires. This cannot be attained without the allegiance of an Allah- Walah as only a Master is the biggest Well Wisher of his follower. An Allah- Walah will guide the person in every walk of life. Following an Allah- Walah will solidify one's belief in Allah and his heart and deeds will always be attentive to the will of Allah. The follower would be able to keep himself clean from the smaller and bigger sins of life in public and private. An Allah- Walah is instrumental for creating the love between his followers and Allah. Allah says about Prophet Moses in Quran, “I have bestowed thee with great love. Whosoever would glance upon you would love me.” Indeed you cannot expect good crop without rains/ watering your fields. You can also not expect the divine love without the intercession of an Allah- Wala. This is a divine system that Allah made Doctors and medicines to cure your physical afflictions and diseases. On the same lines he made Allah- Wala to cure and purify your souls from desires and afflictions. These Allah- Wala help people to connect spiritually with Allah and help them to get ready for Aakhirah, the final destination. It's advisable to ensure that you take your children to pious and scholarly persons (Buzurg). These children would benefit immensely in their company and it would be extremely beneficial for their Duniya and Aakhirah. Their divine light (Noor), Wisdom and guidance serve as a source of betterment. How to identify a real Allah wala (he's an emerald if he is one)? First of all you will see his heart is completely devoted towards Aakhirah, the present world amounts to nothing in front of him, his life revolves around Taqwa (Piety), Sunnah, Sharia and the Commands of Allah. He will never plead for help that is material in nature, even when his needs are extreme. He will guide and advice you to follow the Sunnah and Sharia at all times. Finally his only wish is to help you in all your worldly and Hereafter affairs whenever you seek advice from him, so that you are inclined towards Deen and spirituality. These are qualities you will find in pious and devout people; when you do, hold them firmly and follow their advice strictly. However all medical and legal advice should be taken from doctors and lawyers. Before surrendering yourself to an Allah-wala you must judge him through a multi dimensional approach because exploitation and deception are common these days. If encountered with the wrong ones, you are sure to be sucked out of money energy and capacity. To avoid repentance later, be sure of them. </p><p>"Whoever takes a Wali of Mine as an Enemy ..." Abu Huraira (radiyallahu anhu) narrated that the Messenger of Allah (sallallahu alaihe wa-sallam) said: “Allah, the Exalted said... “Whoever takes a Wali of Mine an enemy, I will wage war on him;and My slave will not perform any act with which he draws closer to Me, more beloved to Me then when he fulfills what I have ordained on him;and My salve will keep drawing closer to Me by performing the Nawafil (voluntary acts of worship) until I love him,and when I love him, I will be his hearing with which he hears, his sight with which he sees, his hands with which he strikes, and his legs with which he walks;and if he asks Me, I will give him; and if he seeks refuge with Me, I will grant him refuge”. [Saheeh Bukharee] </p></div><div class='quote' id=146><p>Our daily needs will be fulfilled according faith. If our Imaan is higher, the needs will be satisfied with honour In-sha-Allah Ta’ala. </p></div><div class='quote' id=147><p>The attribute of “Sefaat E Ehsan” has utmost importance in religion. This was so high in the case of Prophet (PBUH) that sometimes the unbelievers were impressed and this attribute used to come into them also. </p></div><div class='quote' id=148><p>Do not be so impressed and dedicated to anybody that you are obsessed with the person and lose your identity. This way your work and self-esteem will be hurt in the wrong run. Hence be cautious and stay within limits in all relationships. </p></div><div class='quote' id=149><p>A person who is not affected by situations and materials, will be the person who will reap the benefits of Imaan and Taqwa (piety). The signs of Imaan will tell you how much Imaan a person has within himself. Read "Effects of Powerful Imaan" from the book. </p></div><div class='quote' id=15><p>Life is such that everyone is materialistic, seeking their rights, without adhering to their duties and responsibilities. Everyone includes spouses, children, parents, relatives, neighbours and customers/clients, who try to usurp the rights of others. However, such people shall be answerable to Allah on the Day of Judgment. </p></div><div class='quote' id=150><p>Do not let apprehensions or panic attacks (vasvasa) overpower us. Do not be suspicious and doubtful always. This will stress our mind unnecessarily. </p></div><div class='quote' id=151><p>It is a Blessing of Allah Ta'ala that He gives someone abundance of wealth, health and honour along with Deen. But this position is not acquired easily. If you have to choose between honour and wealth always prefer honour. </p></div><div class='quote' id=152><p>Good qualities will develop when a man performs righteous deeds with utmost sincerity and happiness and follows the path of the Prophet PBUH. it is not possible to achieve good qualities without performing good and righteous deeds, </p></div><div class='quote' id=153><p>Plan meticulously before you proceed according to Commands of Allah and Sunnah. </p></div><div class='quote' id=154><p>Expect good from Allah. Satan will attempt to make you lose hope and faith in Allah. Allah says He is seen by people according to their expectations. </p></div><div class='quote' id=155><p>Those who act according to their negative thoughts and vasvasa will be left behind in the deeds for Hereafter. They will do as per their will and skip the congregation Salaah/Namaaz at mosques, disregarding the reward twenty seven times. Good deeds are not so important for such people. </p></div><div class='quote' id=156><p>Don't try to act superior all the time. Don't think that you are right and others are wrong. May be you are wrong and the others are right. Try your best to not let anything negative cloud your mind because what is hidden in the heart starts reflecting through the body and tongue and at times you won't even be aware of it. </p></div><div class='quote' id=157><p>Do not discuss anybody's flaws and shortcomings. It is possible that Allah might punishes us by developing those shortcomings in us. We are unaware of the kind of association one shares with Allah and it is different for each of us. So, we are not one to make any comments. </p></div><div class='quote' id=158><p>There is no way to achieve Allah's help but the way of the Prophet, PBUH . Allah has shut all ways to reach Him without the path of Sunnah. We must grip Sunnah firmly and leave our desires and wishes in the hands of Allah. </p></div><div class='quote' id=159><p>The mind is lost in thoughts and desire spring out and enslaves us. </p></div><div class='quote' id=16><p>Thus, in order to live an orderly life and create a healthy atmosphere to live in, it is required that we live within the limits of the Sharia. Allah has given each one of us some benevolent qualities. So, to bring about goodness in society, we all have to strive to remain loyal to Him and to ourselves. But none of us can become good human beings until we follow the teachings of Islam. </p></div><div class='quote' id=160><p>Kufr, Shirk, Bidaah (innovation), Dishonesty, Sins, Pride, haram, extravagance and name and fame - all these introduce evil thoughts in our mind. Be careful that they don't end up misguiding us by putting us on the wrong track. </p></div><div class='quote' id=161><p>Our responsibility is to perform good deeds and Allah will yield results accordingly. </p></div><div class='quote' id=162><p>Allah has the power to wash away the sins in us and prepare us to enter Paradise with good qualities. This is called rectification of the Nafs. When Allah's Command is solicited upon someone he must have patience. The goodness lies Herein and Hereafter. </p></div><div class='quote' id=163><p>When the Satan fails to entrap somebody in sins he involves him in enormous thoughts. By destroying his mental peace it traps him into depression. In order to avoid these situations the person must search happiness and contentment in permissive acts. He must give up the cause of his problems and anxieties and Insha-Allah peace will be with him. </p></div><div class='quote' id=164><p>Eating what is prohibited will make your prayers go unanswered. If you are a seasoned eater of Haram, you will notice that you speak and act the way you shouldn't. The body gets out of control. Such is how the body reflects with what's going inside it. </p></div><div class='quote' id=165><p>The world is a place to strive. Nobody is at comfort forever. One has to keep striving and be patient. These facets are integrated with life. Human desires are only interested in comfort and pleasure; because of this the mentality of hardship is becoming weaker by the day. Everybody should practice hardships according to their strength, stamina and willpower. This is one of the most important aspect of life, all beauty of Islam is hidden in it. If you see observe the life of prophet PBUH and his pious Companions you might be able to quantify the amount of hardships and pain they could endure. </p></div><div class='quote' id=166><p>We have to keep our heart clean with repeated repentance. If the heart is clean, the light of revelation (Marefat) will be revealed. This gives us the strength to follow the Commands of Allah, this is called the “revelation upon remembrance”. Begging for mercy eases the path of life. </p></div><div class='quote' id=167><p>Stay firm on the path of enlightenment (hidaya) and do not go astray. Pray that you leave the world as a believer. (Imaan) </p></div><div class='quote' id=168><p>Infinite strategies can be developed, but the important one is to follow the path of Sunnah and Allah's Commands. </p></div><div class='quote' id=169><p>Knowledge and education are in abundance but this is not reflected in our actions, as our mind is unable to recall and implement them. The Companion of Prophet PBUH (Sahabah's) aimed at performance. May Allah also give us this ability too. </p></div><div class='quote' id=17><p>All over the world, we find that a large majority of the Muslim Ummah is badly affected by poverty and illiteracy and barely making ends meet in order to survive. In such a scenario, they cannot be left to suffer. So, we, who are more fortunate, need to look after their welfare. </p></div><div class='quote' id=170><p>Knowledge is important because this world is place of deception. We all come to this world with ignorance and have the desire for what is permitted and prohibited. We are inexperienced. without knowledge, professional guidance and counseling we cannot fulfill all goals. So, do not handover any job to an unprofessional person otherwise you will be hassled. Get the job done by a professional. May Allah gives us such an Imaan and knowledge that we can identify the hidden tricks and net of Satan, whether it is within or outside. This is one of the most powerful tools of Man. </p></div><div class='quote' id=171><p>Use of cigarettes, tobacco and gutka once or twice doesn't cause cancer. It's the prolonged and excessive usage that causes illness. Keep your distance from these ills because they do great harm to the digestive system and make the body and mind weak. Due to consuming pesticides through edible foods numerous diseases are cropping up, but the government is not banning them. </p></div><div class='quote' id=172><p>Give your best to your priorities and leave the results toAllah. </p></div><div class='quote' id=173><p>Our dealings should be in writing. Verbal agreements or mental acceptance do little good , because we are bound to forget and also because of our Imaan (faith) being weak, at times money alters our intentions. </p></div><div class='quote' id=174><p>There should be a balance between spending on our needs and donating in charity. An excess of both can result into fallout. </p></div><div class='quote' id=175><p>Some people will chase you only till they need you, they are very cunning and shrewd - their loyalty ends when the benefits stop, they extract the work and walk out when it is done. Identify them and beware of them. </p></div><div class='quote' id=176><p>Plan your exit before entering anything new. Implement this principle in every new sphere. You might get entrapped and become unable to withdraw. </p></div><div class='quote' id=177><p>Offer Salaah/Namaaz with all your heart, recite the Holy Quran impeccably and remember Allah while worshiping. Alhamdulillah </p><p>Salaah/Namaz is such an important gift that only Allah and Prophet PBUH know its depth. It is the same for everyone but different people offer prayer and supplications at a different levels and get rewarded differently. An ordinary Muslim prays specific way, and a Pious( Muttaqi) man prays in a different way, Wali (friends) of Allah pray ina different way. Prophet PBUH used to pray at an altogether different level. They all get different levels of solace, peace, Noor and rewards. To me the best way of praying is protect your senses while praying and keep the mind empty filtered and relaxed so that all Zikr starts from the heart (Qalb) and the Noor of Zikr touches the heart. Make sure that vasvasa & grief, which come from the heart, and thoughts which come from the mind (Memory), should not interfere with your Zikr. Always remember that Allah is watching you. Salaah/Namaaz must be offered with these qualities. May the bygone memories not distract you during your good deeds (Aamaal). </p></div><div class='quote' id=178><p>A famous proverb-whatever happens, happens by Allah's Wishes. everything ranging from the condition of the human heart to the condition of a person's overall life and situations, all happens under His Supreme Command. Allah's Greatness must be involved in every matter through Duas and supplications, involve Him in all your activities needs and deeds. Once Prophet PBUH forgot to say Insha- Allaah ta’‘ala, he had to go without communication with Allah for two weeks, revelations were stopped for two weeks and he was really upset. If one does not involve Allah in all his matters, Allah does not help him in his work; this is a fact. </p></div><div class='quote' id=179><p>One should avoid the places where he may be blamed or wrongly suspected. </p></div><div class='quote' id=18><p>And in order to fulfill this gap, we must perform Dawaah, which creates favourable conditions and improves the quality of life. Just as training a pet can make an animal perfect, we can attain the highest level of perfection and better our lives by doing worthy deeds and helping fellow human beings. </p></div><div class='quote' id=180><p>Life is not so easy and peaceful because it is associated with various circumstances and people. To wish that everything should happen according to your wishes and fancies is a tall order. </p></div><div class='quote' id=181><p>You are wiser after you have been cheated but that's nothing great. Wisdom is in being wise before bearing that loss. At least one should have that much of Wisdom that he seeks advice from someone intelligent before going ahead with a new task. </p></div><div class='quote' id=182><p>There are lots of people who desire to practice silence but are not able to. They are compulsive chatterboxes and it's difficult for them to practice silence. Any adverse situation makes them talk excessively. Practice silence, it's the only way to maintain a quiet composure. When you develop the ability to listen to negative comments without losing your temper or confidence it means you have become mature and truly intellectual. </p></div><div class='quote' id=183><p>Intellect and education may have developed more but not Wisdom. Knowledge is useless without a heightened Wisdom. A computer software has all the instructions on how to douse a fire, but can it actually do it when a fire breaks? No. Someone has to step up and carry out the act. A thing about Intellect: lets combine the entire worlds intellect as 100 percent in totality, out of which Allah has given 99% of it to Prophet Mohammad PBUH and the remaining 1% to all scientists, reachers, engineers and doctors etc. Is it not self explanatory on how intelligent is our beloved Prophet PBUH. His ways are ones filled with intellect & wisdom. </p></div><div class='quote' id=184><p>We should work hard to make our relations with Allah stronger. We should strive to eradicate illiteracy and arrogance. </p></div><div class='quote' id=185><p>Three common concerns of the human Nafs (self):</p><p><ol><li>Investing time and efforts in things which are not necessary</li><li>Pointing out flaws in others and considering himself right</li><li>Being happy over the stress of others. To think that my needs must be fulfilled no matter how much stress it causes to others.</li></ol></p></div><div class='quote' id=186><p>Satan will obstruct the way to justice and truth - do not bother about it. Whatever happens - be just and right. If Allah puts obstructions in the path you chose, then stop. It means do not exceed limits. Seek advice at that time because advice helps in coming up with the right solution. If people and Satan put obstructions do not stop searching for the right solution. </p></div><div class='quote' id=187><p>The person who sacrifices his desires for Allah's Command will improve his Imaan. Allah is pleased with such people. Keep fasts in Ramzan and read Quran as much as you can with the intention that may Allah destroy my animalistic tendencies. Perform Hajj in such a way that all secrets of Imaan, Aakhirah, Quran and Sunnah are fully discovered, because Makkhah and Madinah are the highest place of spirituality in Islam to discover Hidaya and Aakhirah. A trip there must be the turning point of your life. Give Zakat to cleanse your wealth so that Allah becomes pleased. </p></div><div class='quote' id=188><p>It is a good habit not to respond to every comment because silence is golden. </p></div><div class='quote' id=189><p>Our soul is ill and we are weak. May Allah Bless us and have Mercy on us. Pray to Him. </p></div><div class='quote' id=19><p>The messengers of Allah were sent to this world to make it a better place to live in. Even though Imaan comes to everyone through efforts and hardships, it makes a man worthy of life. It is akin to any kind of revolution, which is not possible until we undergo hardships that purify our soul. So, if the fortunate ones keep performing Dawaah, the lives of millions will improve, as currently happening around the world. </p></div><div class='quote' id=190><p>Some people neither have Imaan, faith, reverence and patience, nor any of its symptoms are reflected from their body, yet they desire Allah's help like He provided to His messengers. Is it possible? We still do not know how to talk as per the need of Imaan, such as Insha-Allah, JazakAllah khair, Alhamdulillah and if Allah gives ability etc. </p></div><div class='quote' id=191><p>If you obtain knowledge it gets accumulated in the mind and if you perform good deeds it serves as a repository and a reserve for the Hereafter. </p></div><div class='quote' id=192><p>There should be link between knowledge and deeds. If you have learnt one new thing, implement it 11 times because without it knowledge is futile. </p></div><div class='quote' id=193><p>Doubts keep buzzing in our hearts like honeybees must ignore them. </p></div><div class='quote' id=194><p>Pray all the time that your Imaan does not get destroyed because the Nafs and Satan strive to spoil it. </p></div><div class='quote' id=195><p>If a man does not give up his desires and does not carry out his responsibilities, he will not benefit from any of these pointers. The Prophet (PBUH) bore the responsibility of the entire World and Hereafter, yet he took care of the minutest needs of his family. One day, he went to the house of his daughter Hazrat Fatima (R.A.) and asked her as what was the reason that she went to the house of the Prophet the other day. However today, we consider ourselves great by practicing even little amount of religion. We do not take care of our parents or children. We do not bother about the moral values of our children. We are devoted solely to an odd job. It's time we realize all these. </p></div><div class='quote' id=196><p>Whatever is pending must be made a priority otherwise it will remain incomplete. </p></div><div class='quote' id=197><p>The easy way to protect the eyes is to involve in remembering Allah. Many a time's doubts and suspicions enter our thoughts while performing Zikr and divert our attention. It must be practiced that attention isn't diverted. If we continue those efforts Insha-Allah, Allah will keep the attention maintained. </p></div><div class='quote' id=198><p>We have to strive and pray all along to make our daily life as close to the daily life of our Prophet (PBUH). </p></div><div class='quote' id=199><p>I have seen many people having the ability to perform exemplary deeds, despite their limited knowledge. I am pleased with those people. It is a blessing from Allah. I do not advocate excessive thinking because it wastes time and fails one to deliver on their priorities. </p></div><div class='quote' id=2><p>Thinking correctly is one of the most complicated affairs in life. Why? Misguidance, ignorance, foolishness, deceptions of Nafs, wrong thoughts, wrong understandings, incorrect decisions and forgetfulness can enter your thoughts and misguide your intellect. Therefore always trust Divine Guidance, Professional Advice and aplying Common sense. Desires (Nafsani khawhish) have to be sacrificed when faced with deceptions of Nafs (self).</p></div><div class='quote' id=20><p>On the Day of Judgment, most people will witness that there will be no deeds in their account with respect to their parents. They will be shocked to know this- their whole life was spent in this world yet they could not provide khidmah (service) towards them. These days young generations are always busy with Whatsapp, Facebook and friends, they spent their precious time with, how painful is this thought? </p></div><div class='quote' id=200><p>Backbiting is such a sin that it makes one guilty and causes loss to both Imaan and Deen. May Allah save us! </p></div><div class='quote' id=201><p>If the Commands of Allah are broken and the path of the Prophet neglected, Satan will bring misery and the divine kingdom of Allah will be against us. These obstructions will translate into our daily affairs. Mutual relations will also be hampered. </p></div><div class='quote' id=202><p>My Murshid, Hazrat Maulana Inam-ul Hasan sahib Reh.. used to say that we should strive in the path of Allah, shed tears for Allah and beg Allah, and also be obedient towards the elders. There is no other recourse. The first two Caliphs of Islam, Hazrat Abu Bakr and Hazrat Umar RA, left the world weeping, despite sacrificing everything for the cause of Allah. </p></div><div class='quote' id=203><p>Reformation is a monumental task. It is humongous task to achieve perfection in it. One must put in effort towards it. Prefer a peaceful life - whether in matters of Deen or the materialistic world. You will be exhausted performing good deeds but Allah will never be tired of rewarding you. Practice moderation at all stages, else desires (Nafs) will destroy you. The Prophet PBUH possessed the strength of 40 wrestlers yet Allah warned him through an ayah in the Quran addressing the Prophet “O Prophet! Will you destroy yourself if the non-believers do not become believers?” </p></div><div class='quote' id=204><p>A true Muslim does not believe in breach of trust and never breaks his promises. Insincerity towards commitments is a serious flaw. Satan puts in all efforts to make a person forget his commitments. So, while someone is waiting for the promise to be fulfilled, the person who has committed himself forgets about it. At times, commitments are made ina manner where several people are involved. For example: You have invited someone over dinner and while your family members prepared food for the guests, but the guest didn't turn up. This can be extremely upsetting for all concerned. </p></div><div class='quote' id=205><p>If you are benefitting from some person but some of his flaws hurt you, do not break links with him, instead carry on the relationship and enjoy the benefits you are getting. If you break this relationship even the little benefits will not come your way. Never break a true relation for few faults nobody is perfect, nobody is correct in the end. Affection is always greater than perfection. </p></div><div class='quote' id=206><p>This world is like a mirage. It keeps moving away from you as you chase for it. It is when you stop chasing that it usually comes back. It is for this reason that the essence of Imaan denounces the materialistic world and restores faith in Allah SWT. </p></div><div class='quote' id=207><p>Whenever you listen to the Quran, especially during Taraveeh, ensure that the Quranic recitation of Imam must be carefully listened and must penetrate in to your heart. Insha Allah your concentration in Salaah/Namaz will gradually improve. </p></div><div class='quote' id=208><p>If anyone who has Imaan but commit sins, he will face adversities in life and Allah will punish him. If a person commits a mistake and fails to analyze things properly, he will definitely suffer losses. </p></div><div class='quote' id=209><p>Decide the terms and conditions of transactions and dealings in advance so that no misunderstandings occur later on. Otherwise be ready to face all kinds of chaos. For example: If you have decided ona certain amount as a labours’ wage, ensure that the payment given to the person is accurate. Your dealings must remain as it would be with strangers. Count the money yourself and make a written note of it. Do not just trust your mental faculties. Check if the person who is given a loan has bandwidth to repay it otherwise, relations can be jeopardized. No one should act upon anything without realizing as what can be the possible outcomes of this action. If you do this then you would turn out to be a fool. Do not start a business ventures with the loans. Sadly, Allah does not help in such businesses. Loan causes humiliation in the day and restlessness at night. The Prophet PBUH said, “Whoever knocks the door of the people for his necessities, Allah will close the door on him.” Asking others for favours causes humiliation but refusing it grants you respect. </p></div><div class='quote' id=21><p>It has been narrated that famous Tabiyee Hazrat Owais Qarni RA, was so dedicated to his ailing mothers’ service, due to which he could not become a Sahabah. Despite that he held an exalted status in the eyes of Allaah. Prophet SAW instructed Hazrat Umar RA and one more Sahabah to visit Hazrat Owais Qarni and and ask him to make Dua (Supplication) for them. Does it not dawn upon us the importance of Khidmah towards our parents? Through this you can attain the highest level of spirituality. </p></div><div class='quote' id=210><p>Some people say that they will not go to their place of business because no customers turn up. We must learn to be patient. We can take lesson from the patience of the lizard we usually get to see in our homes. You can see as how it waits near the light endlessly. Allah surrounds the place with insects for the lizard to feed upon. Similarly, if you spend time at your place of business, Allah will send customers to you. It is important to be self-sufficient. It is often said that the world requires wealth and the Hereafter - good deeds (Aamaal). Aman must not leave his children poor. We are so accustomed to extravagance that the moment money comes to us; it goes out of our pockets. Everyone does not have the bandwidth to save money. A millionaire woman once said, “In my life, I have saved coins in a very careful manner.” </p><p>The CEO of a successful IT Company once said to me, “Look after your people, look after your customers”, I feel these are two most important facets of running a successful business organization. </p><p>I once inquired from a CEO as a successful IT, The secret of his Chairman's success. His reply took me by great surprise and inspiration. He said, " The Chairman is extremely focused to his subject of attention, to the extent when we attend a meeting he succinctly maintains the points of discussion and does not deviate from the subject. There is no other point discussed other than the ones he intended to at the on-start of the meet”. </p></div><div class='quote' id=211><p>Do not close your eyes and live a careless life because the world is a deceptive place. Nafs, Satan, desires are our three most deceptive chasers. When you are sent food from someone's house ensure that their utensils are returned as it is. It's embarrassing if there is breakage or misplacement of the utensils. People are often careless about this. </p></div><div class='quote' id=212><p>Only working towards the materialistic world is not enough. The divine kingdom of Allah should be in our favour. All the Prophets have taught us this in their lives. </p></div><div class='quote' id=213><p>People want to see practical performance rather than baseless talks. Our Prophet (PBUH) and his pious Companions showed all this by their deeds and actions. My fear is that if people only talk and do not practice what they preach, others may carry a negative connotation of Deen and distance themselves from it. </p></div><div class='quote' id=214><p>Intellect resides in the heart. It's an Arabic proverb, “If the heart is at peace the mind too will be at peace.” Allah has designed the spiritual heart in such a way that it's only meant to be obedient towards the Quran and Sunnah. So, fill it with fear of Allah, the work of Dawaah, remembrance of death, perform good deeds for the Hereafter, surround yourself with Noor of faith, exemplary deeds and attitude, forgive others faults, practice silence, moderation, shedding tears for repentance, enrich yourself with Wisdom, be good-natured, practice humility and good mannerisms. The heart is at peace when it sheds tears in front of Allah because of the sins one has committed. Focusing on Allah means being humble, so consider it and change your attitude. The heart is pleased to live in an atmosphere like the one at a mosque and in the company of pious people. It is important to have Prophetic manners and etiquettes. One must be less interested in the materialistic world. When the heart imbibes these qualities, it remains at peace. But what is happening today is that we are keeping our heart devoid of feelings, commit sins, haram, unhealthy desires, apprehension and lavish living. And that is the reason why we are all the time under stress and feel frustrated. All the problems surrounding mankind today are the result of a damaged spiritual heart. </p></div><div class='quote' id=215><p>What are the symptoms of a damaged spiritual heart? </p><p>Basically, it is Imaan which gets destroyed since its in the heart which becomes disturbed. Therefore once Imaan is ruined the relationship with Allah is lost and the person gets looped into a negative spiral- gets upset and starts searching for peace in materialistic things. Their actions become rude towards others and they consider the material world as their ultimate solution and begin racing towards it. What they don't realize is, the more they reach out towards it, the more their problems become complex. Almost to the point that every material object starts functioning opposite to its own nature. </p><p>Hatred for fellow human beings develops. </p><p>Situations will occur such that people, animals and even the materialistic world will act peculiarly towards one. </p><p>Anger will unnecessarily flare up. </p><p>Peace of mind will be lost. </p><p>Obstructions will trouble one. </p><p>Nothing will be in one's favour. </p><p>One will only see other's short-comings and flaws. </p><p>One will not take much interest in the obedience of Allah's Commands and Prophet's PBUH Sunnah and doing Ibadat. </p><p>One will not get proper sleep. </p><p>In the end, only frustration, agony and arrogance will surround one. Allah forbid, if he / she dies in this condition they will be destined to the fire of Hell. </p><p>The Prophet Mohammad PBUH said: “There is a piece of flesh dwelling in the human body. If it is flawless, the whole body is faultless, but if it is corrupt, the entire body is badly affected. This flesh is called the heart.” </p><p>Its often noticed that the heart gets unifocused towards one subject and goes "All-in" with great intensity despite the obstacles, odds, troughs along the way. This is seen in people with high determination. Although this helps in the completion of the task, it's not always a good sign. You must understand the need of the hour and plan your move. Hazrat Maulana Zubair Sahib RA advice on this matter is- Moderation (atedaal). </p><p>Cardiovascular heart will never remain perfect until and unless body moves and does some physical activity such as walking and exercises. </p></div><div class='quote' id=216><p>Allah will bring no change to the sect of people who take no effort in reforming themselves. That is why it is very important to reform the Nafs, because of ignorance one should not take a wrong step, which might result in punishment now or Hereafter. Apart from this, there is another purpose that needs our attention - the divine kingdom of Allah should be in our favour along with rewards and achievements. So as when death comes, we go in the state of perfect belief (Kamil Imaan). I have often heard these words from pious people </p><p>“All human beings are dead except the ones who possess knowledge. All learned people will be destroyed if they haven't acted in accordance to their knowledge. All performers will be destroyed if they are not devout enough to please Allah (Ikhlas). At the end all devout and sincere (Mukhlis) people are also under the spectre of great danger. </p></div><div class='quote' id=217><p>Meditate over these three points deeply:</p><p><ol><li>How to maintain my internal peace at any cost</li><li>How to eradicate all evil things from my Nafs</li><li> How to reflect he Prophetic deeds from my body</li></ol></p></div><div class='quote' id=218><p>Allah Ta‘ala is Most Merciful and Benevolent and by these virtues He gives many opportunities to sinners to rectify themselves and mend their ways through repentance. Allah Ta’ala puts the sinners through hardships and problems so that they realize their mistakes and return to the righteous path. But if the person is adamant and remains sinful, then he might face severe punishments from Allah Ta’ala. When one faces hardships and problems, one should ask himself if he has harmed anyone, even unintentionally, or has he done something wrong to someone. At times, it is quite difficult to understand or realize this. </p></div><div class='quote' id=219><p>Wherever there is human weakness, destruction arises. Try your best not to become a slave of your own Nafs. Try to follow the ways of Sunnah, Sayings, Manners and Etiquette of Prophet Mohammad PBUH. Do not let your capabilities be vested in subjects of non-priority. Do not waste your time. Do not disclose your secrets in front of others and do not let yourself be burdened excessively. One is supposed to maintain secrecy in order to protect oneself from all kinds of evil spirits (nazar). </p></div><div class='quote' id=22><p>Another narration from the Hadith I wish to mention, “Once, one of the Sahabah was dying and was unable to read Kalimah. The message reached Prophet SAW and so he went to him and enquired into the matter, Huzur SAW came to know that the Sahabah's mother was unhappy with her son. So, Huzur SAW requested his mother to forgive him. When the mother forgave her son, the son recited the Kalimah and left peacefully for his final journey. </p></div><div class='quote' id=220><p>The real story will unfold at the time of death when no help can be obtained either from your kin nor wealth. We will be left all alone in the grave and would be accountable on the Day of Judgment. We will have to give accounts of our lives, and then one has to face the Prophet PBUH at Hauz-e-Kausar Bridge (Pul-e-Siraat), the decisions of Hell and Heaven for each will be finalized . The solution is obedience of Quran and Sunnah, so hold on to them firmly. </p></div><div class='quote' id=221><p>On Death of Imaan. Hazrat Maulana Yusuf Sahib RA used to say, " Oh Haji sahib and Namaazi sahib, spend time in the path of Allah to achieve concrete Imaan, Imaan achieved only at home will be wiped out during the time of death.” I often think death is a very painful affair, because most of the people die with severe ailments which in itself are so painful. Feeling extreme thirst, the grief to leave the materialistic world and relatives, then traveling towards an unknown destination - the life after death. Satan will also come with a powerful influence of vasvasa and thoughts to weaken and Imaan and Intellect, during all these sufferings and nightmares, is it not easy to die with Kalima (Imaan), in fact, I would say it's very tough. But those who have prayed throughout their life to die on Imaan and led a life according to Sunnah and Sharia, certainly Allah will not dishearten them. He will reward them with the gift of Imaan, I cannot say more than that, it is Allah's own Mercy and Decision to decide who will die on Imaan and who will not. What I can say is that those who are careless and remain ignorant of Khatma Bil Khair might suffer the dire consequences of dying without Imaan. May Allah protect us! So don't be ignorant but be concerned and ask for it throughout your life. </p></div><div class='quote' id=222><p>We will be asked about five things on the Day of Judgment. </p><p><ol><li>1. How he lived his life?</li><li>How he utilized his youth?</li><li>With what means did he earn his wealth?</li><li>How did he spend his wealth?</li><li>And what did he do with his knowledge?</li></ol> </p></div><div class='quote' id=223><p>A man should never be afraid of being cured either physically or spiritually. Whoever fears, will never get cured. If he does not treat his heart and soul, he will lose a lot - Herein and Hereafter. One should consult the pious and doctors and follow their instructions. </p></div><div class='quote' id=224><p>Knowledge without action can be futile, in which thousands are trapped. Some of them do not even realize it till the ability to do good deeds has been seized from them. It is therefore humbly requested that you plan your daily 24-hour lifestyle. All the priorities should be given a fixed time, else nothing will be done perfectly and time will be wasted. It is important to note that whenever you do any job Satan will instill non-priority subjects in your mind and restrain you from doing the priority work. Satan is our greatest enemy, his tricks are innumerable, for example we feel Ghaflah (laziness) most of the time during action, performance and Ibadah. One of the tricks he tries is habituating one to luxuries, addicting one to tobacco and pleasures and making one eat excess food, so that the person becomes lethargic and sleepy all the time, lack of vigour and energy plague him and weaknesses surround him, so that he is not able to perform well. </p></div><div class='quote' id=225><p>Hence, the need is to be alert. Do not let your mind divert at the time of the work in hand. Various distractions such as telephone calls should not interrupt you during your work. For instance, if you have a child, priority is to be given to his education and character building. Some people fail to do this which is why their children ruin their lives. </p></div><div class='quote' id=226><p>Worship makes rewards available to us. However they are subjected to change at the time of sickness. The reward for taking care of your loved ones during their sickness will be equal to the amount of time spent worshiping. Whatever rewards you are to receive through worshiping will be rewarded if you attend and take care of a sick person. </p></div><div class='quote' id=227><p>Evil people can endlessly say and write about good things but it is only good people who can endlessly do good deeds. </p></div><div class='quote' id=228><p>Nafs must be trained for five things: </p></div><div class='quote' id=229><p>a How to suppress the Nafs. </p></div><div class='quote' id=23><p>As stated above, these two instances revealed the fact about the importance of parents for the well-being of their children this world and Hereafter. </p></div><div class='quote' id=230><p>b How to remove the weaknesses of Nafs by sacrifice. c Howtocontrol or ignore Nafs. </p></div><div class='quote' id=231><p>d How to save the Nafs from subjects of non-priority and channelize it towards priority subjects. </p></div><div class='quote' id=232><p>e How to direct Nafs towards good deeds and necessities of life. </p></div><div class='quote' id=233><p>Right from childhood, slavery of Nafs should be strictly prohibited because later on, it can become difficult to change mind sets. Therefore, children should be kept away from becoming slaves of their Nafs. Sadly, parents these days do little to keep their children from following their Nafs. Negative traits, shortcomings and weaknesses like addiction, ignorance of consequences, pleasure, arrogance, forgetfulness and mind slavery are a great drawback in life. Time and again one will have erratic desires and Satan will try to instigate these traits in the mind and heart to destroy one's inner peace and harmony. In order to counter this effectively we must seek knowledge, bear hardships, have self-control and learn to sacrifice, have patience and set our priorities. Without these characteristics none can protect </p></div><div class='quote' id=234><p>themselves from destruction. The best in the world have very high level of execution and intelligence; they get things done fast. </p></div><div class='quote' id=235><p>Human desires are the greatest enemy towards paying obedience to Prophet Mohammad (PBUH). Prophetic Sunnah are disappearing from the world because of worldly desires. Once Prophet (PBUH) said, “A man cannot become a Momin (believer) until and unless his every desire is fully in accordance with the religion which I have brought (the religion of Islam)”. Millions of desires and wishes emerge from the heart but whosoever runs after them and tries to fulfill all of them will be destroyed. That's because addiction to pleasures will keep enhancing in the mind. It's because of this, Allah and Prophet PBUH have prohibited us from fulfilling desires that are haraam. </p></div><div class='quote' id=236><p>There is no way out for a Muslim except to follow the way of Imaan, do good deeds and the work of Dawaah. Our ancestors have been repeating this for years. Because the qualities we need to develop may not develop at home. Allah SWT said, “Oh! My people, you may desire something and so do I, if your desire becomes my desire, I will do accordingly. But if it's only your wishes that you are following and fulfilling, then I will do as per My Wish, which will be against your wishes and might destroyed you!” </p></div><div class='quote' id=237><p>Man must not miscalculate himself. Man thinks highly of himself and underestimates others. He should realize that he is nothing and knows nothing. Truth and justice must rule his mind. This will bring peace to him. </p></div><div class='quote' id=238><p>Don't try to overrule someone's ideology. If the second person is a layman or a novice and is ignorant about certain ways and things, it becomes a challenge to change his/her views. Everybody's struggle is different. They are made to face different tests/challenges and that is why they are made differently. Intellectual people do not argue but those who are arrogant and proud do. </p></div><div class='quote' id=239><p>All of these are not my own sayings. I have learnt most of them in the company of pious people, especially at the Markaz-e-Basti Hazrat Nizamuddin. They were Hazrat Maulana Inamul Hasan sahib R A., Hazrat Maulana Obedullah sahib R.A., Hazrat Maulana Saeed sahib RA., Hazrat Maulana Umar Palanpuri sahib RA., Hazrat Maulana Ezharul Hasan sahib RA., Hazrat Maulana Wahiduddin Khan sahib DB., (not from Markaz), Hazrat Maulana Munshi Basheer sahib RA., Hazrat Maulana Yakoob sahib DB., Hazrat Maulana Ibrahim sahib DB., Hazrat Maulana Ahmed Lat sahib DB., Hazrat Maulana Saad sahib DB., Hazrat Maulana Ismail Godhra sahib Db. , Hazrat Maulana Ahmed Godhra sahib RA., Hazrat Maulana Soleman Jhanji sahib RA., Hazrat Usman Bhagal sahib RA., Hazrat Maulana Yunus Palanpuri DB., who are working very hard to spread the messages of the Quran and Hadees through WhatsApp and of course my Murshid, Hazrat Maulana Zuberul Hasan sahib RA who passed away very recently.</p><p>I would like to mention a few names of those who have contributed towards Deen for the Ummah and are one of the most intellectual people are Hazrat Dr. Nadir Ali khan Sahib DB, Dr Khaleed Siddiqui sahib DB, Dr. Sanaullah khan sahib DB. Prof Abdur Rehman sahib DB, and Brother Farooq sahib DB from Banglore, Janab Abdul Aleem Sahib DB and Janab Fateh Mohammad sahib DB from Aligarh. Their intellect and Wisdom have helped all of us. They have devoted their life for the survival of Allah's Deen and are highly respected by our elders at Markaz Nizamuddin. My journey into Islam and Management was inspired by an exceptional personality brother Shaikh Ghanim Al Faris Al Mazrui from Abu Dhabi. It was he who showed me the light at the end of the tunnel and the path to take up. </p></div><div class='quote' id=24><p>Companions of Prophet Muhammad PBUH believed in preaching moderately but performing extensively. They depict the epitome of model character. Their preachings were largely their actions that rippled over centuries and brought back Islam to life and Deen into practice. How powerful is the act of doing that goes longer and ever extends into making believers for life. They've peaked the performance in Islam and their only message was the way they lived through this journey. </p></div><div class='quote' id=240><p>Do not forget to build a strong relation with Allah, you must wake up in the middle of the night for Tahajjudh, shed tears and beg Allah for your well-being in Duniya and Aakhirah because everything is in the hands of Allah and all the work will be done according to His Wishes. Save yourself from sins and forbidden things (haram), do the work of Dawaah till death, serve and respect your parents, especially your mother because she has brought you up with great difficulties. By doing this, your heart will fill with immense peace and pleasure and Allah will help you in your work. You will be happy and content. Be consistent, focused, humble and dedicated towards the above- mentioned points. </p></div><div class='quote' id=241><p>I have written this book to protect myself and others from the deception of the materialistic world and to get benefits out of it (materialistic world) by adopting the right principles. But my fear is that it should not make people to take advantage of only Duniya. Basically, non-believers do not understand the secret of the present world. All they understand is that Duniya is for themselves and nothing else. Today's Muslims have also become materialistic. They only know how to draw benefits from others, nothing else, by telling lies and following illegal means to do things. They neither understand the consequences of Duniya, nor that of Hereafter. They are not bothered about the Commands of Allah or death, graveyard, Heaven and Hell. They think they are not accountable to Allah. Not only are they doing it themselves but are also making their children slaves of Duniya. May Allah save as from such ideas and miseries. Allah does not keep love for the materialistic world and that is what He wants us to follow all the time in life and imbibe the same teachings in our children. Remember one thing, those who are the slaves of Aakhirah, Allah will reward them in plenty (Barakah), but those who only wish for worldly pleasures now, Allah might reward them with some of the comforts and luxuries, but they will not get any benefit in the Hereafter, because their target was only Duniya. There's a famous saying, “People cannot get more than what they are destined to receive”. </p></div><div class='quote' id=242><p>“Be scared of Momin.” Allah has gifted them with a special vision (Ferasat). They can detect and realize hidden secrets of certain things, good or bad. Think of the consequences first, have enough vision, common sense, correct knowledge, power to make decisions and to take timely correct action. These are very precious gifts for a man to lead a beautiful and balanced life. Follow these instructions and teach your children to act accordingly. </p></div><div class='quote' id=243><p>Today there are a lot of differences developing between Muslims and non-Muslims, by the spontaneous media coverage. To be honest, some ignorant Muslims behave in an unjust manner. Let's hypothetically say: Today Mr. Michael steals something, but the entire Christianity will not be blamed. Similarly, if Mr. Shivram kills someone, people will solely blame Mr. Shivram for his act but his religion, Hinduism, will not be blamed. But if Mr. Abdul Jabbar commits a crime, people will not blame Mr. Abdul Jabbar alone, but the Muslim community as a whole. This is what media is doing and blaming all Muslims and Islam. Muslims have to stay with non-Muslims and vice versa. We are all Creations of Allah, who has created us in one religion but in different communities. A famous writer, the late Mohammad Rafique Zakaria sahib used to always say that we should take as much good as possible from non- Muslims, without compromising with our religion, faith, dignity and respect. We may not like many things, but we must do so for the sake of peace and harmony, just as our Prophet (PBUH) did at the time of Suleh-Hudaibya. </p></div><div class='quote' id=244><p>Often, I have heard the following from pious people:</p><p><ol><li>Listen to the sermons carefully. Whatever Allah wishes to convey He shall do so via the speech of the intellectual orator. So, always try to become a good listener.</li><li>Wherever you go for a particular job, finish the job and come back. Don't go here and there and get distracted.</li><li>Quarrels and fights bring misfortune and the body becomes weak. So stay away from such evils.</li></ol></p></div><div class='quote' id=245><p>At times you need to scold your mind and ask it why it thinks so much about people and the materialistic world instead of thinking of the Creator and Sustainer. May Allah reward us with this kind of wisdom and attitude. </p></div><div class='quote' id=246><p>The inhabitants of the present world are not as simple as you perceive them to be. Learning how to deal with their psychology is essential to extract work from them. I have a principle, “Being tough with the tough and gentle with the gentle.” </p></div><div class='quote' id=247><p>On the day of Judgement, the ill mannered and the ones with pride will be thrown in the fire of Hell solely for their anger and wrong attitude. They have dampened their relations with others and fallen in the eyes of Allah. Pride is the climax of ego and arrogance. They were perpetrators of injustice and excessiveness. Intellect evaporates because of anger and also makes one forget consequences of the same. There is no control over what one says during anger, which is the climax of ego. When angry, refrain from hurting the other person through words or deeds. For, the wounds take a long time to heal. To be kind is more important than to be right. Many times what people need is not a brilliant mind that speaks but a kind heart that listens. Often it is seen that a person with weak Imaan ‘disconnects’ with Allah Ta’ala due to the hardships faced in life, as his faith dwindles. He then becomes frustrated without reason and starts spoiling his relationships with others by way of quarreling and fighting. When someone acts as a brute, a rude person and uses violence upon someone, he forgets that its not only one person upon whom the misbehaviour is inflicted but that act hurts more people attached to him. This is true for both sides- the inflictor and inflicted. Most heart related conditions such as thyroid, high blood pressure, kidney ailments and liver issues are linked with anger in most patients. Humility develops when efforts are made towards building a moral character. May Allah bless us with this kind of behaviour. When there is a lot of grief in the heart and the mind is stressed out, watch out; for it can result in cerebral accidents as strokes. Adopt a gentle tone when speaking, because, at times, the tone has a greater impact than the speech. Please beware, be cautioned that Allah Ta’ala's angels are noting all our words, actions, intentions and all these will be accounted for on the Day of Judgment. O Allah“if I hurt others, give me the strength to apologize, if people hurt me, give me the strength to forgive”. Ameen. When you face two imbeciles at such dismay.

If it is mere dream the life will pass thinking. I often suggest to my children these things, remember Allah in silence and calmness, remain focus towards duties and responsibilities then perform them through Sunnah; this way neither are neglected, practice self control, so that you don't commit any evil. World is a place of deceptions, displeasures and filled with Satan's trap so have knowledge and patience to counter them. </p></div><div class='quote' id=26><p>All praise be to Allah - the most Gracious and the Most Merciful, Who has solutions to all our problems. He processes solutions to problems Herein and the Hereafter (Duniya aur Aakhirah). He is the Lord and the only owner of honour, humiliation, success, failure, sickness, health, life and death. To believe that Allah Sustains and Satisfies the needs is all about Imaan. Man gets peace if he firmly believes in destiny and other aspects of Imaan (IMAAN e MOFASSAL). Imaan seeks that reasons and sources must be adopted or discarded in view of Allah's Willingness. Allah Ta’ala taught this to Moses through a stick and a serpent. Imaan means believing in the invisible. Allah's book, the Holy Quran, as well as Prophet Mohammad (PBUH) commanded this. Moreover, the work of Dawaah is designed to strengthen Imaan. Unless the materialistic world is rejected, the fragrance of Imaan cannot be smelled. Imaan is a hidden treasure and Allah knows best how much of it one has and this truth will only be exposed at death. All Companions of Prophet (PBUH) were highly afraid of hypocrisy. Fourteen hundred years ago, a Companion (RA) of the Prophet used to say that he found his Imaan weaker as soon as he buried Him (Prophet PBUH). Today, after such a long period, only Allah knows the condition of our Imaan. While all the hypocrites consider themselves to be a firm believer, the true believers are afraid of hypocrisy. The strength of Imaan fluctuates so quickly that one who is considered a believer in the morning becomes a non-believer in the evening and vice-versa. May Allah save us all, Ameen. Imaan grows stronger in the path of Allah where Allah is repeatedly praised and His Greatness and Importance is constantly acknowledged. Imaan turns weak when situations from Allah are associated with the materialistic world. However, it grows stronger when situations are associated to be from Allah. For the believers of Allah, Allah becomes sufficient for them, for the believers of the materialistic world, Allah hands them over to that world. Trust only Allah, never keep any hope on people and materials if you do that you will regret later. One of the beauties of Imaan is ---those possessing it, the materialistic world and situation does not impact their heart much than those whose Imaan is weakened they act the exact opposite and suffer in agony. Striving hard for Imaan develops the importance of good deeds (Aamaal) within the Heart, which is the key to success. When there is confrontation between the Commands of Allah and one's, desires fulfill Allah's Commands but do not violate His Commands, have patience, bear some hardship, sacrifice some comforts temporarily, such as pleasures and materialistic goods, but do not violate the Commands of Allah at any cost, this is the most powerful test of Imaan. Once the Commands of Allah have been fulfilled, Allah will reward us with Imaan and a strong bond with Him and His help and his Hidden Kingdom will favour us. Whenever you see wrong being done, prevent it with your hand if possible. If not, prevent it by speech, but if even that is not possible, then at least take ill at heart. This is the lowest level of Imaan. We should strive and pray for the safety and purity of our Imaan. If you want to Know the present condition of your Imaan judge it from the chapter Effects of Powerful Imaan (faith)</p></div><div class='quote' id=260><p>Do not forsake Allah and his messengers and seek peace elsewhere.

Remain completely focused to the subject you are presently dealing with. What happens during performance is that ‘focus’ gets diverted towards non-priority subjects. Every muslim needs a powerful focus that allows him/her to retain unperturbed concentration while listening Quran and reciting Zikr of Allah.

Someone said it rightly. “Does the eagle want to swim in the sea? Is it being restricted by the sky? Does the fish want to dance in the wind? Isn't there enough water in the sea to explore? Yet, the sky means freedom for the bird, but death for the fish. The sea is wide enough for the fish, but will engulf the bird. We ask for freedom but freedom to do what? We can only express our nature as it was created. The prayer mat of the earth is freedom, freedom from slavery for some, but not for others. Who offers a shoreless ocean of love to swim in and horizon that extends to the next life? Yet, we chose the prison and call it freedom.” </p></div><div class='quote' id=283><p>Allah doesn't burden anyone's Nafs or body more than their capacity and strength. </p></div><div class='quote' id=284><p>The Pious usually remain in pain even if they try hard to achieve a certain amount of comfort. This is perhaps because Allaah wants to repeatedly test them. All the prophets and his companions despite being the most exalted of all human beings have been repeatedly put through tests. Allah has His own yardstick of measurement. </p></div><div class='quote' id=285><p>Once I asked my dear friend Ahmed Irfan sahib-- why do we face problems, whether is it Azmaish or written in our destiny? To that he comely replied, "Azmaish and Tests are for the highly pious people. Each of us faces problems for the sins we have committed in the past or bad and evil deeds have done or took wrong (Haram) step in our life. So Tauba, Ashtagfar, Tears and following right path is our ultimate solutions to escape the punishment of both Duniya and Akherah. </p></div><div class='quote' id=286><p>Do not share your secrets with your friend.

Control your speech as it is the root cause of many evils. Force your body to follow the Sunnah, Sayings and Manners and Etiquette of Prophet (PBUH). Develop patience, perseverance and passion for sacrifice in the mind. Otherwise, the five senses will be influenced by the materialistic world and start erratic behavior such as tyranny and bad temper. Try to increase your threshold of tolerance in the mind so that the mind does not go to wrong directions by seeing some displeasure. Satan is our hidden enemy. We don't see him but he sees us, and his tricks are so devious that even intelligentsia, at times fail to identify him.

Allah forbid if these capabilities (time, money and efforts) are utilized in an inappropriate manner, then the Herein and Hereafter will be ruined.

When the fear of Allah disappears from one's heart then one should know that it is the time for introspection. </p></div><div class='quote' id=31><p>I want to draw your attention to an important aspect of Islam, which is humanity and the real compassion of the heart, which was given by Allah Ta'ala to the Prophet (PBUH) and his pious Companions. Nowadays, this compassion is vanishing from our hearts. Whenever Prophet (PBUH) would see a mother loving her child, his heart would melt at the sight. Whenever he would see an animal in distress or a man suffering from an ailment, he would be grieved. Once, seeing the pathetic conditions of Hazrat Mus'ab bin Umair (RA), who used to be a prince, Prophet (PBUH) felt a lot of grief and he wept, seeing his suffering. Similarly, whenever Hazrat Usman (RA), one of the companions of Prophet (PBUH), passed by a graveyard, he would weep to such an extent that his beard would get wet. When strong winds or storms occurred, the facial expressions of Prophet (PBUH) would change. He would start fearing Allah even more, and would pray for the peace and wellbeing of the Ummah. But today, our condition is such that even after listening to the tragic incidents of Taif, our heart is not affected. Even the problems and sufferings of loved ones such as parents and children do not affect our heart. Even after listening to entire Quran during the Salaah of Taraweeh in Ramzan, a single drop of tear does not fall from our eyes. We don't know what has happened to our hearts. Most of us have already lived a major part of our lives, but do not acknowledge the proximity of death nor are we preparing for it. All hearts are controlled by Allah SWT. If He is pleased with our good deeds, He will certainly gift us with the Noor of Imaan and Enlightenment (Hidayah). </p></div><div class='quote' id=310><p>It is not right to just sit and keep praying and hoping that Allah would turn things around. Allah says in his Holy book that Allah helps those who help themselves. You need to act and take right decisions and actions at the right time. One had to be bold and be confident. Allah has bestowed this characteristic in many people who always display patience and march ahead with courage. </p></div><div class='quote' id=311><p>Say good things about life.

Truly Allah knows everything. </p></div><div class='quote' id=315><p>When Allah loves anyone then He desires to bring that person on the right path. If he/she does not come on right path then He puts him/her in difficult and awkward situations.

Keeping people waiting unnecessarily is unprofessional and unacceptable. However, at times we have to change our time schedule for some meaningful purpose. For example: If you have an appointment with someone for an important cause, then observe tolerance and patience for the cause.

Everything is useless if you do not commit right deeds. When our Prophet (PBUH) was going for Meraaj with archangel Gabriel then he sws saw a certain things going up and something is coming down. He sws asked upfront form Gabriel as what are they. He replied the ones which are going up are the deeds of your Ummah and the one which are coming down are the outcomes in accordance to that. If one has done good deeds then he/she is blessed and if one has committed a wrong deed then the outcome is also according to that. </p></div><div class='quote' id=333><p>One should try to save himself and his family before doing it for others. Many a times people spend their time, effort and money on others to such an extent that they themselves and their family members land up in awkward positions. I have observed in aircrafts that people wear life jackets first before helping others. Fire brigade people wear the necessary uniform and use right equipment to help the fire victims. Therefore we should try to help ourselves and our family members first. There is a famous saying - charity begins at home. Allah also says in His book to save yourself and your family members from the fire of hell. </p></div><div class='quote' id=334><p>One should do self-analysis and introspection whether one is feeling alright from inside or outwardly. The feeling of wellness and wellbeing should be there. If this is not the case here is my solution. Cut off from all your thoughts and people. Stay in a secluded place in the house, close your eyes and relax. Stop thinking for a while and let your mind and body relax for a while. You would feel good after a while Inshaallah. </p></div><div class='quote' id=335><p>We are ignoring two Sunnahs of our Prophet (PBUH) these days. These are siesta after lunch and going to bed early after the Isha prayers. If we sleep early then we might get the chance to offer the Tahajjud Salah (Night prayers) and might attend the congregational prayer of morning (Fajr Salah) in mosque. However people keep awake till late night and end up missing both. </p></div><div class='quote' id=336><p>Aperson not only communicate through his tongue but also through his body. This is called body language. A few people do not pay attention at all to this. many people are afflicted with mood swings which may be due to some disease like thyroid or high blood pressure etc. When such people enter the house then it appears as if they are coming from acemetery. One should always have a cheerful disposition. It's a great blessing. This is one of the Sunnah of our Prophet (PBUH). When I was in London then I noticed that people were always serious. May be this was due to the workload, lifestyle or inflation. It is not right to be like this always as it may led to depression. </p></div><div class='quote' id=337><p>Nowadays people want to fulfill their desires irrespective of the concern whether this would hurt others or not. Such people do not </p></div><div class='quote' id=338><p>consider other person's sentiment, compulsion and situation. People remove their employees in the fit of anger. People have to learn restraint, patience and sacrifice to achieve the peace of mind. It isa fact that whatever happens in this world happens as what Allah wills. There is a fixed duration and time for everything to happen. Nothing can happen before the destined time. One should always be mindful of Allah's will in the work he/she strives for. </p></div><div class='quote' id=339><p>Please take this very seriously what you say has very serious implications on your followers, please do make sure your followers get the best and never anything bad learnt from you or any leader who guides them. </p></div><div class='quote' id=34><p>With the help of Imaan, Quran and Sunnah always keep your heart at peace, then remain busy towards your priorities, present sufferings and future sufferings which are yet to come according to Commands of Allah and Sunnah. Identify your short comings and try to eradicate from the root one by one. Bear some hardship and suffer little bit but do not ignore them. Do not refrain from good deeds because of Satan's attacks. Majority of people face problems because of lack of awareness and not being attentive.

It is contrary to the conduct of a true believer to rejoice over the trouble of another Muslim as this attitude is very much disliked by Allah. There is every possibility that Allah may punish such a person in this world and relieve the one who is in trouble. </p></div><div class='quote' id=343><p>What are the diseases and cures of Nafs? </p></div><div class='quote' id=344><p>Allah has made the human body weaker compared to many of his creations. Many a times a person remains unwell. He may be tired but his Nafs keep him egging on and force him to complete his worldly </p></div><div class='quote' id=345><p>desires. He may not be physically strong enough due to illness or tiredness to bear the outcomes of the fulfillment of his desires but his Nafs keep him pressurized to fulfill his desires. If a person follows his Nafs blindly then he would fall sick. It has been observed many a times that a person may not be able to digest food any further but he gets carried away and end up overeating. This results in acidity, indigestion and possibly other discomforts. </p></div><div class='quote' id=346><p>The cure of Nafs is that a person dislikes what he was fond of earlier. E.g. a person was fond of music, movies etc. but once he got an initiation in the spirituality his spirit drives him away from these things. However, this can happen only when a person has got divine intervention and he has overcome his worldly desires. Once he gets a taste of spirituality, his belief gets strengthened. He starts disliking what he was fond of earlier. This is called the cure of Nafs. However, this cannot be attained without the hard yards in the field of belief and the pursuit of truth. </p></div><div class='quote' id=347><p>These days people are getting hurt/ discomforted by the excessive usage of the mobile phones intentionally or unintentionally. If a person calls you and you are not able to collect the call for whatever reason(s) then he/she starts speculating and feels hurt. One must remember that if a person has dialed you a phone then he/she might have dialed you for some specific reason. It is similar to knocking on someone's door and no one responding to that. If you are not able to respond to the call then you must call back whenever you get time. These are one of the teachings of Islam. I have personally dialed many a great scholars/ servants of Islam. They pick up or responds call immediately else would always call back. However, people tend to ignore phone calls of their friends, relatives, colleagues and employees. This is a very bad practice. </p></div><div class='quote' id=348><p>Why are our children getting wayward? It is observed these days that people do not spend time to bring up their children properly. First of all they themselves are not religious or are aware of the nitty gritty of their religion. They do not even try to pay attention or inculcate these Islamic habits among themselves or among their children. If both of them are working then the children are brought up by grandparents or maids/servants of the houses. When both the parents are busy in work or chatting on mobiles with their friends then how would they bring up </p></div><div class='quote' id=349><p>their children in a desired manner. Parents should leave other things aside and pay attention to their children. If a person goes out with Jama‘at then it is his responsibility to ensure that his home environment is also religious. It is observed that a person befriends new people and is always busy chatting with them. If he is always busy like this then how would be bring up his children. </p></div><div class='quote' id=35><p>There are many negative forces which are hidden within our body such as prohibited (Haram) desires, useless things, mere words, the lust for power and wealth, any kind of evil and prohibited luxury, (Haram women, food etc.) these things should not destroy the light of our Imaan and priority. Otherwise our present sufferings will multiply. The meaning of Deen is to prepare for the Day of Judgment and show less interest in materialistic goods. The lust for worldly desires makes us incapable to collect good deeds (Aamaal) for Hereafter. </p></div><div class='quote' id=350><p>These days we see some Muslims indulgent in bad practices. They lie, take bribes, torture others and give little respect to others’ rights and expect their lives to turn out perfect. </p></div><div class='quote' id=351><p>About that a little narration: we should know that our Prophet Hazrat Muhammad (PBUH) had spent his life at 2 places as a Prophet. In Makkah and Madinah--a total 23 years. The first 13 years at Makkah and the next 10 years spent in Madinah. In Makkah he (PBUH) worked with his Sahabah to develop a strong Imaan. That was his only mission and aim. Once Imaan had deep rooted itself the Commands of Allah were fulfilled without any difficulty. Then when the Prophet (PBUH) moved to Madinah and spent the 10 years, the guidelines from Allah SWT started pouring in. Sahabah began following it one after another (Salah, Hijab, prohibiting usury and alcohol). His companions (RA) followed them too without difficulty because of their strong Imaan. Nowadays its uncommon to see people trying to perfect their Imaan (faith) instead they desire to have an ideal life. Unless our Imaan is perfected we cannot obey the Commands of Allah and cannot differentiate between good and evil. This explains the importance of Imaan in shaping a perfect life. The work of Dawah is a unique struggle to develop Imaan. The inception of which, was by Hazrat Maulana Ilyas sahab Reh. This effort was made to replicate efforts of the Prophet PBUH and the course he took 1437 years back. Quran and Hadith have clearly mentioned if we don't strive in the path of Allah for the survival of His Deen instead are busy enjoying life with worldly bounties, they all will be in trouble. </p></div><div class='quote' id=352><p>Aperson does not have to strive too hard to be evil. If he does not try to become good then he becomes evil by default. It’s similar to situation that you can grow good crop if you put in effort but the same field can </p></div><div class='quote' id=353><p>become a habitat of insects and reptiles and it would have thorny bushes. The good initiative and efforts of Dawah can lead to a good life and help one to become a better human being. </p></div><div class='quote' id=354><p>Hazratjee Reh... spoke about those who thought they knew everything-- they are blindly unaware of being those who don't even know that they know nothing. </p></div><div class='quote' id=355><p>Someone told me that Hazrat Ali Miyan Nadwi RA had an outstanding characteristic among many.

It has often noticed that at the in-laws’ house only her faults and short comings are pricked upon which results in more disagreements, disrespect of one another, thereby agonizing everyone from the newly wed bride to the members of the household. As a result, this phase leaves her frightened, distant and she grieves her marital decision. She starts developing hatred and distances herself from them. We forget that our evil deeds such as backbiting (geebah) land in the court of Allah and in return bring displeasure and punishment further making the house chaotic and a difficult place to live. </p></div><div class='quote' id=357><p>It is advisable to the in laws that you must shower love, kindness and be forgetful and forgiving towards the bride's short comings and instead highlight her good qualities and praise her in matters - big or small. We forget she has left everything for your family and that your son is reaping the comforts provided. At the same time, it is also advisable that the newlywed bride show great obedience, respect and offer her services (khidmah) to the groom's family to the best of her ability. Insha-Allah by doing so Allah will return her good deeds with great rewards such comfort, peace, love and respect towards each other. This will protect both from the net of Satan. </p></div><div class='quote' id=358><p>Those who are most active after Magrib Salah suffer more stress and undergo a damaging sleep pattern as opposed to the others active </p></div><div class='quote' id=359><p>after fajr.

Now when the illiterate and arrogant people act or talk inappropriately or foolishly, it gets absorbed through senses in the mind which multiplies the tension in the brain. It is because of this multiplication one starts behaving rudely and harshly to the extent of even causing physical abuse, torture etc. The only solution to this apathetic condition is- forgive people and increase your threshold of tolerance and instead become a peace loving man. Once you develop these qualities you will inadvertently achieve peace. For you cannot change them it is better you change your attitude.

If anyone pays against his wish under the pressure of too much insistence then it would be against his wishes and he would be inconvenienced. People do not collect phone calls and start ignoring and avoiding them who keeps insisting. Many institutions send very young students for collection who call out people for contribution. It is not right as this habit of asking for help may get ingrained in their young minds and they become habitual of this trend. A man grows used to do when a task is repeated time and again.

In most cases, kidney problems are caused as a result of a primary condition like diabetes, hypertension or high cholesterol levels. Because the symptoms of kidney diseases are not evident unless the kidneys are deteriorated to a great extent (to about 15 percent of their normal capacity), you should regularly screen your kidney function (especially if you suffer from heart disease and diabetes).

Read more about the medication for high blood pressure. </p></div><div class='quote' id=394><p>Blood Creatinine Test: Creatinine is a waste product that is produced by your muscles. It enters the bloodstream and is filtered by the kidneys to get excreted through the urine. A blood creatinine test will measure the amount of creatinine in your blood. A higher level (greater than 0.8-1.2 mg/dl in men and 0.6-0.9 mg/dl in women) may indicate that the kidneys are not functioning properly. </p></div><div class='quote' id=395><p>Blood Urea Test: Urea is a waste product filtered by the kidneys and excreted through the urine.

The kidneys filter out toxins, excess salts, and urea, a nitrogen-based waste created by cell metabolism. Urea is synthesized in the liver and transported through the blood to the kidneys for removal. </p></div><div class='quote' id=403><p>Water level balancing: As kidneys are the key in the production of urine, they react to changes in the body's water level throughout the day. As water intake decreases, the kidneys adjust accordingly and leave water in the body instead of emitting it out. </p></div><div class='quote' id=404><p>Blood pressure regulation: The kidneys need constant pressure to filter the blood. When it drops too low, the kidneys increase the pressure. One way is by producing a blood vessel-constricting protein (angiotensin) that also signals the body to retain sodium and water. Both the constriction and retention help restore normal blood pressure. </p></div><div class='quote' id=405><p>Red blood cell regulation: When the kidneys don't get enough oxygen, they send out a distress call in the form of erythropoietin, a hormone that stimulates the bone marrow to produce more oxygen-carrying red blood cells. </p></div><div class='quote' id=406><p>Acid regulation: As cells metabolize, they produce acids.

They think they are right, but it is vital for them understand that they may be wrong, while others may be are right. If we remain ignorant and arrogant, we will suffer even more. Anybody who thinks and acts against the Quran and Sunnah will see peace disappear from his/her heart. Those who desire to eat unhealthy food all the time will see their health to be deteriorated. An interesting thing about the purified human spiritual heart is that it (the heart) will accept only which mention an the Quran and the way of life of Prophet (PBUH) Sunnah. He (PBUH) and his pious Companions (RA) have left a particular way of life which is fully compatible with the intricacies of the human heart. This means, if we do not follow these principles and choose a different path, our heart will not accept it and we will become restless and hence suffer in life. </p></div><div class='quote' id=410><p>The Prophet of Islam is most renowned in the annals of history for the greatest revolution in religious thinking and practice, which he set in motion in the seventh century AD throughout a major part of the civilized world. But what is perhaps lost sight of is that it was not only the strength of his religious conviction, but also his great personal charisma, in a situation fraught with all kinds of adversity, which brought adherents to his side, first of all with painful slowness, then with a heartening acceleration of pace. </p></div><div class='quote' id=411><p>The most tolerant of all men, he was very gracious, kind-hearted, and invariably polite and considerate of the well-being of others. He claimed no right to take precedence over his fellow men, walking behind his Companions generally with his eyes cast down, refusing to take a position of prominence at gatherings and always greeting others first. He treated everyone equally, making no distinction between rich and poor, would gladly accept the invitation of slaves and servants, and when mixing with them, would exhibit no pride whatsoever. He never affected the airs of a great man. He would put people from all walks of life at their ease, whether joining in their celebrations or caring for the sick and needy. No one was ever made by him to feel disheartened or despairing. Whenever anyone came to consult him about anything, he would give him a patient hearing and wait respectfully until he had had his say. In fact, he always used to behave so open-heartedly that each person he encountered left him feeling that he (the Prophet) loved him best of all. A person in need was always given something by him, and if he had nothing to give at that particular time, he would always promise to give something later. In fact, he was never known to have acted in a miserly way. In company, his manners were perfect, particularly in the way he sat and ate. He would never eat on a full stomach and avoided over-rich, spicy food. He would never complain that something tasted or smelt bad. He would simply not eat it and at the most would refrain from praising it. When it was his turn to play the host, he would entertain his guests to the best of his ability, speaking light-heartedly, and modestly, and occupying any place which he was given. He would smile but he would not laugh loudly. He always spoke softly, for he disliked any noise or fighting or disorder, and would even address his enemy gently. Always at pains to maintain harmony in all his relationships, he took good care never to malign anyone, even in the face of blatant misconduct. </p></div><div class='quote' id=412><p>One thing he could never condone was cruelty and he kept his distance from those who were callous in their behaviour to others. He himself never mistreated anyone, never even slapped an erring slave or servant, and certainly never hit a woman. He could not bring himself even to beat an animal. He refrained from finding fault with things and people, showing forgiveness even to those who treated him badly -even if it meant suffering losses or damage to property. As Hazrat Anas explained, “I served the Prophet for ten years, but whatever I did during that long period, he never asked me why I had done this or why I had done that.” There was not the least trace of vengefulness in his nature; he never used to lose his temper with people in personal and domestic matters, and never stooped to the use of coarse language. His treatment of relatives, friends and neighbours was exemplary. But nothing would contain his anger if he felt that disrespect was being shown to the Sharia. Then he would either point out to the detractors the error of their ways, or he would just depart. Often he would simply turn his face away, so as not to display his displeasure. Whatever he chose to do, it befitted the gravity of the situation. He himself went in fear of the The Almighty, and treated every small boon as a great blessing from The Almighty. Never did he disparage any of Allah's bounty to man. All of his life was spent in remembrance of his Creator— “whether sitting or standing”. He performed the obligatory prayer so sedulously that his feet would become swollen, and during the recitation of the Quran, he would weep out of love and fear of his Maker. His reverence for Allah was such that he always spoke quietly and never in excess of what the situation warranted. He was outspoken in his abhorrence of falsehood, and not even a thoughtless word ever passed his own lips. Self-praise was also something which he disapproved of and he did not even like the Companions praising each other. </p></div><div class='quote' id=413><p>His conduct towards others was consistently humble and gentle. In particular, he never liked to create problems for his Companions, explaining everything to them slowly and clearly, so that they should never become confused as to the true meanings of the divine revelations which formed the bedrock of his divine prophetic mission. And if he avoided exaggeration, he also avoided excessive brevity. Even in everyday matters, he would take care not to disturb them in any way. For example, if he had to go outside late at night, he would be careful to make no noise putting on his shoes or in opening and closing doors, so that no one should lose their sleep. This absence of pride was also apparent in his home, where he did not shirk domestic chores, working methodically and doing everything with his own hands. The Prophet PBUH said “ He who loves my Sunnah has loved me, and he who loves me will be with me in Paradise.” Someone said, “Never ignore a person who loves you, cares for you, and misses you because one day you might wake up and realize, you lost the moon while counting the stars”. </p></div><div class='quote' id=414><p>If we investigate the qualities passed by the Prophet PBUH within someone else it will cause misunderstanding. We Muslims must remember that we are the Ummah of a Prophet PBUH who was extremely good mannered. Therefore, we should also adopt good manner and behavior. For that matter we have to read Urdu literature. Learn yourself and let your children learn. This will create mannerism. My request is not to let the ego be within our heart and betrayed by our body as this will cause failure.

But at the same time, it is not easy to act in accordance with them. It is advisable not to seek too much information but seek right and relevant knowledge suitable for your daily life. We spend so much time on Social Media like WhatsApp, Facebook and Twitter in exchanging tons of information, jokes, ahadith etc. How much of that is implemented in our day to day life? It is better to perform righteous deeds one after one, quietly. The results are bound to happen. There was a time when people suffered due to ignorance and insufficient knowledge; this is reversed now with the explosion of information. People are now suffering because of their attempts to amass excess amounts of irrelevant knowledge. Buckets of Knowledge can never be completely filled, which provokes further accumulation. People miss out on their priorities in their pursuit of unnecessary knowledge. This is causing undue wastage of time and energy and has become a habit. In this age watching, reading or listening to information is becoming increasingly interesting and addictive, fuelling the thirst for more information—thus our priorities are neglected and often left incomplete. Priorities serve as the base of one's actions, so when they are undervalued, our sufferings take on a new shape. Knowledge without practice and implementation is useless. The best in the world have very high level of execution intelligence they get things done fast.

The brain does the thinking, learning, and feeling for the body. For humans, it is the source of consciousness. The brain also controls basic autonomic body actions, like breathing, digestion, heartbeat, that happen automatically. These activities, and much else, are governed by unconscious functions of the brain and nervous system. All the information about the world gathered by our senses is sent through nerves into the brain, allowing us to see, hear, smell, taste and feel things. The brain processes this information, and we experience it as pictures, sounds, and so on. The brain also uses nerves to tell the body what to do, for example by telling muscles to move or our heart to beat faster. </p></div><div class='quote' id=496><p>When negative thoughts dominate our mind our physical potency becomes incapable to tolerate the pressure.

The importance of Dawaah is by virtue of this only. It has been proven that Allah's Help and Blessings are hidden by performing the work of Dawaah. This is the duty of every common person so the help is also common. The six points of Dawaah itself are so important and vast that no one could write or explain completely. All the messengers of Allah were sent to this world with good qualities and characteristics, but we individuals have to develop those characteristics and qualities by striving hard in the path of Allah (Dawaah). Work of Dawaah brings a very special kind of peace and tranquility in the heart and mind which normally does not come through any other work of Deen. Those who neglect to perform this work with consistence often face various hindrances to their daily life such as poverty, obstruction and scarcity (Be-Barkati) etc. This is a proven fact. </p></div><div class='quote' id=500><p>3.

This can also happens if one does not closely monitor the internal rhythm of his body. For a Muslim, pressure builds in mind and heart once the heart lacks Noor-e-Imaan and a strong relationship with Allah, right from its core. Food cravings and anger are dangerous for heart. Make sure at all times softness and kindness is surrounding your heart. Its fragrance heals faster. On the other hand, hardness and harshness are evil - and the root cause to many ailments. </p></div><div class='quote' id=507><p>What I need to do during my ailments?</p><p>Follow principles followed at hospitals this would help us cure most diseases.

Some doctors prescribe Alprax to counter this situation. </p></div><div class='quote' id=51><p>It is necessary to provide comfort to mind and heart if one feels tired after working hard for the cause of Dawaah. Ponder that you are a sinful man and repent for past sins by asking for forgiveness from Allah SWT. Also consider that you know nothing as whoever considers himself a humble person will be at an advantageous position. Make sure that your mind does not divert to various useless subjects, if it happens then the mind will be overburdened. Just stop thinking, control and ignore thoughts, relax and try to filter the mind at this situation. Pray to Allah SWT for giving you a stress-free life, without any ailment, poverty, sorrow and ultimate destruction. For more relaxation and stress-free life, it is recommended that you exercise and travel, when possible, to de-stress and remove unnecessary worries and tensions. It really helps. Take deep tissue and head massage as it is very useful. If you suffer pain in the right side of your body it means you are working very hard without taking proper rest known as physical stress and if it is on the left side of your body it indicates that you are suffering from emotional stress. </p></div><div class='quote' id=510><p>“Our Lord!

Thou art our Protector; Help us against those who stand against faith.” O Allah, Help me save from the entrapments of Satan. O Allah, Keep me steadfast on the path of Sunnah! O Allah, verily I do not know where from I will get my sustenance? Indeed to look for it I lay myself open to possible risks which threaten my heart. I go round in its search to (many) places. O my sustainer, give me abundant sustenance, make easy for me its seeking, let its source be near me and let me not in vain run after the sustenance You have not selected for me, because You do not want to punish me whereas I am always in need of Your mercy. Save me from afflictions! I should neither have stress, nor difficulties. O Allah, forgive me those sins which tear apart safeguards! O Allah, forgive me those sins which draw down adversities! O Allah, forgive me every sin I have committed and every mistake I have made! O Allah, help me carry out my commitments and my responsibilities viz. my responsibilities towards my parents, my family, my neighbours, my subordinates.

The beginnings are usually with bitterness and adversity. All of Allah's actions are hidden with Wisdom and knowledge. Allah (SWT) wants us to be free of our addictions in our Mind, to reduce ignorance, prohibit us from certain things (Haram or not suitable), to develop the experience, to do reform (Tarbiyat), to reflect on our wrong doings and short comings, to be focused towards repentance (Tauba), to teach patience, faith (Imaan) & belief (Yaqeen), to put to Test, to remind fate (Taqdeer), to develop self-control, to fulfill the Commands of Allah and to show us the right path enlightenment (Hidayah).

It's when you forget consequences and commit a mistake during performance disaster takes form. Often think that I am weak, dependent on Allah, ignorant and know nothing. Remain focused to present subject and sufferings. Try to stop thinking and keep the mind empty, relaxed and filtered. These are powerful tools of the mind. Excess Vital Life force (Nafs) should not enter in your thoughts to create more stress and chaos. For Hereafter: Think of Imaan, virtuous deeds (Aamaal e Saleha) and self control.

Satan will try to inculcate these bad habits in our system. But, Insha Allah, at the same time the work of Dawaah provides all of us opportunities and strength to get away from these bad habits. You are out in the path of Allah to suppress your own Nafs not others. Sincerely, silently and willing accept this bitter truth. Iam concerned that Satan might make you a slave of your own Nafs by following its orders all the time. Remember-many people are worshiping their Nafs not Allah, when they return home they enter with a huge and powerful Nafs. They have been eaten well, slept much, spoken more and spent according to their desired of their Nafs not Allah's Command. suppressing your Nafs is the hidden secret of Deen and a beauty of Islam which we are neglecting these days.

Without doubt the work of Dawaah is one of the biggest and most important gifts from Allah to this Ummah. But there are times when this work immerses people into itself so much so they neglect and forget there are other priorities equally important for the survival and longevity of Allah's Deen. This gives rise to a belief of its lessened importance. </p></div><div class='quote' id=610><p>The secrets of thoughts are hidden in spiritual heart where the Wisdom resides. When it is in peace, useless thoughts do not bother much but if it stressed out then mind surrounds with endless useless thoughts.

I wonder why it so happened. </p></div><div class='quote' id=612><p>The strength (Imaan) to carry out certain activities (Commands of Allah) and the importance of principles (Sunnah and Taqwa) that restrict one from wrong doings (Haram) is termed as a Blinkers On.

What happens during performance, ‘focus’ tries to divert towards non priority subject and mind starts wondering, leaving behind the present work and priority. It is the non-priority subject which creates hindrance towards your priority. If your focus and thoughts are exploited your capacity and capabilities are automatically destroyed.

Take the heart towards Imaan, Yaqeen & Taqwa and try to keep it within the boundaries of Quran and Sunnah by doing the work of Dawaah. The more we develop this, the more faith (Imaan), belief (Yaqeen) & piety (Taqwa) we will be rewarded with and the impact on the senses by the materialistic world and situations will be less. This is Meditation (Morakaba) at its best. </p></div><div class='quote' id=615><p>Fear yourself and closely monitor yours and others’ erratic behavior because various inhuman tendencies (Sins, pollution, injustice etc) are hidden inside.

Store that knowledge which you need in your daily life, excess information will create undue stress & burden your mind (Sensory overload) into developing stress related problems.

If various adversity, discomforts and tribulations surround you, first pause, have patience then think for what reason are you facing these adversity ? Have you committed a sin or done a mistake? Then, watch your thoughts, speech, and actions; which should not violate the Commands of Allah& Sunnah of Prophet (PBUH), rather it should please Allah more. </p></div><div class='quote' id=628><p>While facing various worldly discomforts and adverse situations one should not be confused or commit mistakes but instead, fulfill his own responsibilities, rights of others and collect Pearls (good deeds) for the Hereafter.

This is the sole reason millions of people are sacrificing home comfort and spending time in the path of Allah.

Just follow correct principles and remain focused towards all duties &responsibilities proportionately. Must learn </p></div><div class='quote' id=63><p>My book mentions those time-tested techniques and details the importance of an Allah-walah. Another case in point, it has been duty noted that some of the followers of Khangah do not give much importance to the workers of Dawaah, and are of the view that these people are just wasting their valuable time and money without much gain. I think they are over-looking how often the Quran and Hadees mention the very importance of the path of Allaah and its consequences upon its neglect. As clichéd it may read but this Deen surfaced and made its way to us because of that very struggle and strife. Today you can see its success and scale on how Farz, Wajibat and Sunnah have survived again which at one point almost disappeared from many parts of the world. Not only this but the number of people who have given up their past life and rooted out their evils, repented and adopted a righteous path, do we not see that? </p></div><div class='quote' id=630><p>moderation and own limitations.

With the help of these precious things with your own strength and ability, try to sacrifice desires, and mind Slavery for the Commands of Allah& Sunnah of Prophet (PBUH) and for the work of Dawaah. When there is confrontation between the Commands of Allah and one's, desires fulfill Allah's Commands but do not violate His Commands, have patience, bear some hardship, sacrifice some comforts temporarily, such as pleasures and materialistic goods, but do not violate the Commands of Allah at any cost, this is the most powerful test of faith (Imaan).Once the Commands of Allah are being fulfilled, Allah will reward us by purifying our soul first, will send enormous Blessings to our material world, will surround Peace, Comfort and Happiness which are the shadow ofHeaven .Not only to these during departing the present world (Death) He will reward us with Paradise, human's ultimate success. The Real success is here. Never ignore or become insincere towards the Sunnah of Prophet ( PBUH) at any situation. </p></div><div class='quote' id=632><p>Train your Nafs in such a way, so that it does not influence you with negative and wrong thoughts. Whatever work you do, the same thoughts develop in the mind, that is why from time to time it is important to clean the mind from all junk thoughts of the materials, these are only possible if we focus towards, Imaan, Yaqeen, Fear of Allah, Zikr of Allah, Dua andAstaghfar. Throughout your life you should think yourselves as a sinner and try to shed tears in front of Allah for your sins committed. By doing this, Insha- Allah, heart will be soft and kind. It is very important to learn how to switch on and off between several activities. Always maintain self respect and dignity in front of others. Be cautious about talks and action because Allah's hidden decision reflects in the life according to our activities and performance whether good or bad. </p></div><div class='quote' id=633><p>If you are kind and merciful towards Allah's Creations, certainly He will send His enormous Blessing. Develop self control - just the way a jockey rides his horse with his rein and whip.

Always fear Allah, while facing displeasure, start reciting Zikr of Allah in abundance, then ask Allah to seep in Imaan, Yaqeen, Sabr, Taqwa and Tawakkul into your heart. Try to refuse all materialistic and worldly belongings and its induced effects. Then cleanse the mind from all evil thoughts and watch your focus so it doesn't divert you towards any non priority subject. But sadly, without understanding the secret of the heart and mind it would be difficult to implement. </p></div><div class='quote' id=636><p>Remember Allah in complete silence and calmness. Be present (Labbaik). The Heart has its own pair of eyes, use one eye towards the Zikr of Allah that listen to recites Zikr of Allah with full devotion. The other eye should guard the mind from retrieving past memories and entering your thoughts to divert the focus towards materialistic world and its people. Insha-Allah if you recite or listen to Zikr of Allah through this technique you will achieve lots of Noor, Sakina, Imaan, Barakah and peace. In day-to-day life, practice the same principle for instance while eating, one eye should remain focused towards Sunnah and other should guide the mind. </p></div><div class='quote' id=637><p>Do Tauba, astaghfar and recite Daroodshareef to keep your heart (Wisdom) clean and transparent, so that the signs, guidance and Noor from Allah easily penetrate. </p></div><div class='quote' id=638><p>If you don't have a strong intellect then the Mind stumbles upon subjects of non priority and that directly affect your productivity, quality performance and Aamaal.

Try to stop thinking, ignore thoughts or control them. Keep </p></div><div class='quote' id=639><p>your mind junkfree, avoid negative thoughts and keep it relaxed and calm. It depends on how much Peace you have in your heart (Wisdom). </p></div><div class='quote' id=64><p>There are two very powerful facets of this work one — on how it strengthens Imaan and the other the sacrificing of Nafs giving strength to temporarily giving up homely comfort such as your wife, children and business.

A strengthened Imaan will change the very course of our life. </p></div><div class='quote' id=640><p>Act on your priorities with confidence, execution with Intelligence and Commands of Allah and Sunnah. Do not get influenced by situations and material at all. In the company of others your manners should be perfect, do not backbite and criticise people. Always maintain secrecy. Many people behave foolishly and regret later. </p></div><div class='quote' id=641><p>To counter vasvasa, Say 'No' with emphasis and have self-control (patience) towards all addictions, pleasures, bad habits and Haram (Sins). Most people are trapped by Satan's net in these four things. Always remain focus on the Nafs and practice self-control so that you don't commit any evil. Nowadays people are also lost in social media like Facebook, WhatsApp, Smartphones and tablets, forgetting or neglecting their duties, responsibilities and priorities. If these happen sufferings will multiply. </p></div><div class='quote' id=642><p>Take decision and act according to your own mental, physical, emotional, spiritual and financial conditions.

Clearly a deception driven thought process. Workers of Dawaah must remember one thing, Sahabah not only sacrificed their lives in the path of Allah but also spent quality time with our beloved Prophet Mohammad PBUH company. Their tarbeith was carried out by Huzur Sws(PBUH). All the Taabayii took tarbieth from Sahabah R.A. and all the Tabe Tabeyee took Tarbieth from Taabayii R.A. and this remained the sequence. Today a similar sequence is absolutely missing. It gives me grief to state that the Nafs is no more rectified in the way it should. People are not attached to Mashayaks, some considering Dawaah as the be-all-and- end-all for ultimate reformation, I like to believe otherwise. </p><p>I have had the blessed opportunity to spend quality time with the most pious of Sheikhs and Mashayaks. The book that I have written is the essence of their teaching.

It was still in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean when it was hit by a severe storm. The ship began to shake violently. All the passengers panicked. They began running hither and thither. It seemed that the ship would sink at any moment.</p><p>In this hour of crisis one of the passengers caught sight of a child in a corner of the ship, playing with her doll. The passenger asked the child: 'Do you know what is going to happen?” The child asked in all innocence', 'What is the matter?” The Passenger replied:" Our ship has been hit by a storm, and it is going to sink." Continuing to play with her doll, she replied: " you Know, my father is the captain of the ship. He is not going to let it sink.” </p><p>This incident gives us a picture of a truly spiritual person. A truly spiritual person never falls prey to frustration. He does not become overwrought in times of crisis. He never loses courage. He always lives in hope. In every situation, he is in a position to say: </p><p>"Allah Almighty is the captain of my ship. He is not going to let it sink.” </p></div><div class='quote' id=711><p>It is imperative to understand and correct your intention. It is one of very important thing in religion. Lest it happen that you focus only on one thing and end up ignoring the rest. When you are praying then you should have your 100% attention towards Allah. When you pray from the bottom of your heart and pure attention then Allah would bestow His blessings unto you. These blessings may count as peace, guidance, sustenance, strength of heart, courage, happiness and grace etc. </p></div><div class='quote' id=712><p>However, one should be mindful of these blessings and remember that this world is a place for tests and tribulations. We have to counter many different situations and circumstances. Many of them would be very unpleasant which would serve as a lesson for our overall improvement. We may run into these circumstances due to our negligence or outcome of any of our prior act. They may be a tool to remind us about Allah and Aakhirah or they may be to break our false pride. These difficulties can be of many kinds. However, disillusion and confusion can be heart breaking. Every mankind has to undergo this. Satan also play devious to mislead us. Once upon a time some people said uncharacteristic things about the pious lady like Hazrat Ayesha (RA). This resulted in grave hurt to our Prophet (PBUH). May Allah save us from disillusion and unpleasantness the way He saved Hazrat Ayesha (RA) by revealing Surah Bara’at (Ameen). There is certain wisdom behind every unpleasant or difficult situation which we do not understand. Its only when they get over then we can realize the learning of those circumstances. </p></div><div class='quote' id=713><p>One must evaluate carefully before every transaction or interactions. These days people befriend strangers over WhatsApp and Facebook and then rue things later on. Difficulty is a great teacher for our reformation but none of us like it. However, Allah cures many of our physical and spiritual ailments through difficulties so we should pay attention to that facet as well. One must pray Allah and follow the traditions of our Prophet Hazrat Muhammad (PBUH) at all times to get benefitted from these situations. One should be fearful of Allah and obey Him regularly. </p></div><div class='quote' id=714><p>After seeing or listening to anything what our brain will comprehend, who will take the guarantee of that?

It could be anyone for that matter in any form of business or profession- be it a doctor, engineer, pilot etc. More so it becomes an obsession of innocent simple people to be giving in charity in the name of Allah, as they get hypnotized. It is advisable to first verify their background details before investing your time and money in them. People with weak faith do indulge in such things. When someone wears a topi and has a beard and calls himself Allahwala, then any common and simple man will believe him and in all likelihood be fooled by the appearance. </p></div><div class='quote' id=716><p>According to Holy Quran the world is a place of deception.

He used all his navigation skills but neither did he find any way out of the jungle nor could he find any food to eat for 8 days at a stretch. He started feeling so damn hungry that he could eat an entire elephant at one go. Disappointed, he lost all hope. And that is exactly when an apple tree caught his sight. He collected a dozen apples to feed him for the rest of his search. </p><p>As he ate the 1st apple, his joy knew no bounds and he just couldn't stop feeling grateful and blessed. He thanked life. He thanked to Allah He could not believe his luck when he ate the 1st apple but he was less grateful while having the 2nd apple and even lesser grateful when he had the 5th apple. Somehow, with each passing apple, the hunger still kept on increasing and the joy kept on reducing drastically. He just could not enjoy the 10th apple. Why? He had already taken for granted the gift of having found an apple tree in the middle of a forest after 8 long days of wandering with hunger. When he took the 10th apple in his hand, he was still very hungry but he just did not feel like having it any more. Economics calls this diminishing marginal utility. I would like to call it diminishing gratitude, in simple words, taking things for granted. Or let’s just call it the 10th apple effect. </p><p>The 10th apple did not lack taste, it did not lack the potential to satisfy his hunger but the only thing lacking was his gratitude for finding food in the middle of the jungle. </p><p>The hunter represents us. And the apple represents the gifts that life gives us. The 10th apple represents our lack of gratitude for these gifts of life and our ‘take everything for granted’ attitude. As we continue receiving the gifts of life, our hunger, our greed keeps on increasing and the joy we get from these gifts diminishes. </p><p>Imagine the joy you get when you deliver a baby and hold your baby in your hands for the first time. The gratitude you have in that moment, for life and for Allah is unmatched. But what happens as time passes? Do you get the same joy when you look at your child every single day? Do you still find enough happy time to spend with your kids? Never let the 10th apple effect make you feel less grateful for the gift of a child. </p><p>The 10th apple is as sweet as the first apple. If the 10th apple fails to give you as much pleasure as the first one, nothing is wrong with the apple, everything is wrong with you. If you get bored on a dull day, it is not because the day is dull and boring. It is because your gratitude has become dull and boring. The gift of life for another day cannot be taken for granted. The year of life should seem as exciting as the 16th year, as the 25th year, as the 50th year. </p><p>Never let the ‘10th apple effect’ make you take these gifts of life for granted. Never let your gratitude for life fade away. Happy life! </p></div><div class='quote' id=722><p>How to survive a heart attack when alone? </p><p>1. Let’s say it’s 7.25pm and you’re going home (alone of course) after an unusually hard day on the job. </p><p>2. You’re really tired, upset and frustrated. </p><p>3. Suddenly you start experiencing severe pain in your chest that starts to drag out into your arm and up in to your jaw. You are only about five km from the hospital nearest your home. </p><p>4. Unfortunately you don’t know if you’ ll be able to make it that far. </p><p>5. You have been trained in CPR, but the guy that taught the course did not tell you how to perform it on yourself. </p><p>6. Since many people are alone when they suffer a heart attack without help, the person whose heart is beating improperly and who begins to feel faint, has only about 10 seconds left before losing consciousness. </p><p>7. However, these victims can help themselves by coughing repeatedly and very vigorously. A deep breath should be taken before each cough, and the cough must be deep and prolonged, as when producing sputum from deep inside the chest. </p><p>8. Abreath and a cough must be repeated about every two seconds without let- up until help arrives, or until the heart is felt to be beating normally again. </p><p>9. Breathe deeply! Get oxygen into the lungs and cough to squeeze the heart and keep the blood circulating. The squeezing pressure on the heart also helps it regain normal rhythm. In this way, heart attack victims can get to a hospital. </p><p>Tell as many other people as possible about this. It could save their lives. </p></div><div class='quote' id=723><p>How to go ahead with spirituality? </p><p>Everybody's effort and struggle is different from another and Allah does their reform (Islah) according to his/her own situation, that is why it is very difficult to suggest or write something which is standard for everyone as a ready reckoner. However, I have tried few things which are very common to our daily life. </p><p>Initiate the process to enter the realm of spirituality by the constant and consistent Zikr (Remembrance) of Allah. Once we start the Zikr with Ikhlas (sincerity of intent) then the Zikr would enter our heart and would cleanse the heart from dirt, malice and worldly things. We need to pray Allah to cleanse our heart and gift with Imaan, Yaqeen (concrete belief), fear of Allah, Ikhlas (pleasing Allah) and Sunnah (way of life of Prophet Mohammad PBUH). </p><p>Once we follow these dedicatedly we will realize that some divine power is developing within ourselves. This is known as the power of Imaan, the most important asset of a man/ woman. Now while doing this we have to remain focused to see what is happening in the mind. During and after any action, mind starts thinking and analyzing. Human brain is strongly related with five sensory organs and past events. In general during any situation/circumstances human brain is always trying to retrieve something from the repository of past events and sending those messages to the mind to stimulate the thoughts, so that mind diverts to somewhere else leaving behind the present work in hand. If a person is able to control it, then Satan and Nafs will try to work on senses, so that the person takes impact from the materialistic world and its people and start thinking about those things, again leaving behind the present work in hand. The quality of work suffers when the person is not able to concentrate on the job in hand. We can experiment these while trying to sleep. </p></div><div class='quote' id=724><p>Basic principle of any work is to keep the heart and mind clean and empty by doing Isteghfar. Then start the work by reciting Bismillah and always remain focused to the present work and follow its principle (Sunnah & Commands of Allah) which we need to practice in our day to day life, but the devil will always play game by diverting and exploiting focus and thoughts throughout our life whenever we intend to do something. </p></div><div class='quote' id=725><p>Now come to another point. Never forget the “Tests/tribulations from Allah” (Azmaiesh) and adverse situations (Nagawari) it is a part and parcel of our lives. Hidden deception of Nafs, Satan and Khawhish will remain with us in the form of anger, arrogance, Stress, pleasures, laziness, forgetfulness etc. untill we die. What are these destructions which triggers from the heart? you need to understand by reading my “ Secret of Heart” chart.

It is a fact that some thoughts and problems would always burden us definitely as we carry out our everyday life. However, we should not bogged down with them to the extent that it destroys our peace, happiness, tranquility and drags us to many stress related diseases. To counter hidden destructions we need to hold three principles viz. sacrifice, patience and hardship (Mehnat) firmly. However the bigger question is where will we get that willpower? It is the work of Dawah where we will achieve that power to counter destruction, if we spend quality time in the path of Allah everywhere we need to wait, tolerate, sacrifice and obey. </p></div><div class='quote' id=727><p>Identify your own personal short comings and destructions and get rid of from there, for example Mr.Abdullah is suffering from stress, diabetes, high blood pressure, food cravings, tobacco addiction and laziness (ghaflat) so he has to cure these diseases otherwise destruction will strike through these path.

If your mind is stressed because of the pressure of work, tension and materials, chances are that your systolic blood would be on higher side but if you are undergoing family related stress, then your diastolic blood pressure would be higher. Try and keep a mild temperament and calm behavior. Try to abandon harshness of the heart and soul. Abandon eating eggs, fish and meat. We should have plain foods that are given to patients in the hospitals. We should stick to a vegetarian diet most of the times. Try and eat less salt. Avoid smoking and use of tobacco in any form. Be calm at work and home. Have sound sleep for eight hours and walk for 45 minutes five times a week. It is necessary for cardiovascular fitness. Do breathing exercises by inhaling and exhaling as per the fitness regime. The mind and lung need oxygen for which we should walk in open spaces. Massage your head, feet and skin regularly. Don't put stress on the mind. Take caution in thinking and talking. Do not live in stressful conditions. Believe in doing charity. Seek Blessings of Allah and the Prophet (Darood-e-Paak) and repent for your sins (tauba and astaghfaar). By doing all this, your blood pressure will automatically come down. If not done as suggested above and rules are broken, blood pressure will never become normal. Do not stop taking medicines for blood pressure without the advice of the doctor. Otherwise, it can lead to trouble. Allah forbid if blood pressure increases at 110-200 in the night, immediately refer to a hospital. Keep blood pressure between 120 and 80 in any case. Do not panic due to the rate of blood pressure. In order to balance the blood pressure it is necessary to strengthen Imaan because though, doubts and memories of a troubled past may disturb a man, if he has Imaan, he will sleep calmly and all doubts will be cleared. May Allah save everyone from being paralyzed. Due to sickness and stress, a patient is not fit to think rationally. So, do not make any decision as per the will of the patient. Have trust in the doctor and act according to his advise. Many times a patient insists that he will not go to the doctor, or to the hospital and refuses to undergo any medical tests. But any such excuse of the patient should not bog one down. Whoever will give in to these excuses may have to face the brunt and pay for it heavily. So, in spite of all attempts, if you are unable to sleep, you may take a medicine to fall asleep, because lack of sleep can be more dangerous than taking a sleeping tablet. Life is so fast today and that's the reason for our restlessness and impatience. One should be in constant and regular touch with a good doctor and get all parameters checked regularly like blood pressure, blood sugar and cholesterol level. However don't just blindly base your judgement to one doctor's opinion, consider a second opinion. </p></div><div class='quote' id=89><p>The brain : Brain is the most complex organ in the human body and perhaps the most remarkable. From enabling you to think, learn, create and feeling emotions to controlling every blink, breathe and hear beat-- this fantastic control centre is your brain. </p></div><div class='quote' id=9><p>Still, all is not lost if we understand the fact that success lies in abiding by the Commandments of Allah and following the path of Prophet Mohammad PBUH. For, he was sent as a messenger of peace for the entire universe. </p></div><div class='quote' id=90><p>Human desires (Nafs) always lead to destruction except for those who have been bestowed by the Mercy, Benevolence and Kindness of Allah SWT, who provides them the ability and aptitude to adopt good habits and perform good deeds. This is one of the best guidance for spiritual people. </p></div><div class='quote' id=91><p>There lies a blank space within the hearts of children. The parents, who fill up this blank space by their love and restrain the fondness for other unwanted things from entering into the hearts of their children, are blessed. There is an old saying that children go where they get immense pleasure and stay where they get love and affection. So, do not let your children get spoiled. Restrain them from bad company as well as bad habits, extravagance, watching TV for long hours, surfing the Internet on computer or on mobile phone or downloading filthy videos or songs on the ipod. Since it is not possible for children to not use the computer these days or possess a mobile phone, they must be permitted to avail these things for a certain times and prescribed hours. Many people are so occupied in their own worldly chores and religious activities that they forget to take care of their children and repent later, when the children become wayward. This is a common phenomenon these days. </p></div><div class='quote' id=92><p>My mother always used to say be sincere to all your priority work such as health, finance and official work etc. so that you dont suffer chaos in life. </p></div><div class='quote' id=93><p>Whoever resolves his matters with Allah, He creates benefits and enables that person to lead an easy life. The person is able to garner the support of others. Whoever has mercy upon the creations (makhloogq) of the earth will enjoy the mercy of the Heaven. We must treat our staff and servants well as they take care of our family members and us. </p></div><div class='quote' id=94><p>One should not forget humility and good behavior even at a time when one is angry. People who forget these fundamentals of life, often feel embarrassed by their behaviour and repent later. </p></div><div class='quote' id=95><p>To help people, to cooperate with relatives, neighbors, the vulnerable, the poor and the needy, to help orphans and widows - are the teaching symbols and glory of Islam. Being on good terms with relatives (sil-a-rehmi) pleases Allah Ta‘ala. We should not have malice and jealousy towards our relatives and should not fight with them over petty issues. We should be humble and careful while dealing with our relatives and friends and give them due consideration because if a relationship breaks, it can cause pain and agony to all in the family. </p></div><div class='quote' id=96><p>Civilized and honorable people are fortunate, while uncivilized people are unfortunate. May Allah save all Muslim Ummah from ego and darkness of illiteracy (jahaalat). The ego is a negative trait while self- respect is a positive trait. But many people are unable to differentiate between these two and hence get embroiled into unnecessary hassles. It is said that the honour of a person lies under his control. He may sustain it or may lose it by his own behavior and deeds. The humble the person, the happier he is and lives a long and cherished life. “We are nothing and we know nothing” is a lovely notion, which provides so much peace to mind. </p></div><div class='quote' id=97><p>The law of Allah Ta‘ala is equal for all people. He Commands that all children must obey and respect their parents. That all wives must abide by their husbands. The humanity should serve the needy and the handicapped. </p></div><div class='quote' id=98><p>We should always be grateful to Allah for His enormous Blessings. If we don't do so, then Allah's Will might take away His Blessings from us. </p></div><div class='quote' id=99><p>Man should have the ability to take the right decision because during unpleasant situations and difficult times we have to face precarious conditions. If we take a wrong decision at that time, we will suffer in many ways. </p></div><div class='buttons'><div><button type='button' id='new'>New Quote</button></div><div><button type = 'button' id = 'share'>Share Quote</button></div></div></div>
