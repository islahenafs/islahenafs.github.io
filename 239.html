                        <p>All of these are not my own sayings. I have learnt most of them in the company of pious people, especially at the Markaz-e-Basti Hazrat Nizamuddin. They were Hazrat Maulana Inamul Hasan sahib R A., Hazrat Maulana Obedullah sahib R.A., Hazrat Maulana Saeed sahib RA., Hazrat Maulana Umar Palanpuri sahib RA., Hazrat Maulana Ezharul Hasan sahib RA., Hazrat Maulana Wahiduddin Khan sahib DB., (not from Markaz), Hazrat Maulana Munshi Basheer sahib RA., Hazrat Maulana Yakoob sahib DB., Hazrat Maulana Ibrahim sahib DB., Hazrat Maulana Ahmed Lat sahib DB., Hazrat Maulana Saad sahib DB., Hazrat Maulana Ismail Godhra sahib Db. , Hazrat Maulana Ahmed Godhra sahib RA., Hazrat Maulana Soleman Jhanji sahib RA., Hazrat Usman Bhagal sahib RA., Hazrat Maulana Yunus Palanpuri DB., who are working very hard to spread the messages of the Quran and Hadees through WhatsApp and of course my Murshid, Hazrat Maulana Zuberul Hasan sahib RA who passed away very recently.</p><p>I would like to mention a few names of those who have contributed towards Deen for the Ummah and are one of the most intellectual people are Hazrat Dr. Nadir Ali khan Sahib DB, Dr Khaleed Siddiqui sahib DB, Dr. Sanaullah khan sahib DB. Prof Abdur Rehman sahib DB, and Brother Farooq sahib DB from Banglore, Janab Abdul Aleem Sahib DB and Janab Fateh Mohammad sahib DB from Aligarh. Their intellect and Wisdom have helped all of us. They have devoted their life for the survival of Allah's Deen and are highly respected by our elders at Markaz Nizamuddin. My journey into Islam and Management was inspired by an exceptional personality brother Shaikh Ghanim Al Faris Al Mazrui from Abu Dhabi. It was he who showed me the light at the end of the tunnel and the path to take up. </p>
