                        <p>The messengers of Allah were sent to this world to make it a better place to live in. Even though Imaan comes to everyone through efforts and hardships, it makes a man worthy of life. It is akin to any kind of revolution, which is not possible until we undergo hardships that purify our soul. So, if the fortunate ones keep performing Dawaah, the lives of millions will improve, as currently happening around the world. </p>
