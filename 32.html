                        <p>Always be on time, punctuality of time is extremely important. Keeping people waiting unnecessarily is unprofessional and unacceptable. However, at times we have to change our time schedule for some meaningful purpose. For example: If you have an appointment with someone for an important cause, then observe tolerance and patience for the cause. Times are rapidly advancing and information is easily accessible on your fingertips, so the precious qualities such as patience and tolerance are diminishing. </p>
