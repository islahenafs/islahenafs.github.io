                        <p>Companions of Prophet Muhammad PBUH believed in preaching moderately but performing extensively. They depict the epitome of model character.

How powerful is the act of doing that goes longer and ever extends into making believers for life. They've peaked the performance in Islam and their only message was the way they lived through this journey. </p>
