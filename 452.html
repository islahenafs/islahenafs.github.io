                        <p>Why blood pressure, thyroid, blood sugar and heart ailments are common these days? </p><p>Brain has a task to look after our body. The brain does the thinking, learning, and feeling for the body. For humans, it is the source of consciousness. The brain also controls basic autonomic body actions, like breathing, digestion, heartbeat, that happen automatically. These activities, and much else, are governed by unconscious functions of the brain and nervous system. All the information about the world gathered by our senses is sent through nerves into the brain, allowing us to see, hear, smell, taste and feel things. The brain processes this information, and we experience it as pictures, sounds, and so on. The brain also uses nerves to tell the body what to do, for example by telling muscles to move or our heart to beat faster. </p><p>When negative thoughts dominate our mind our physical potency becomes incapable to tolerate the pressure. This destroys our peace and calmness. This affects our Adrenal Glands - which becomes weak gradually. Both the kidneys have adrenal glands which discharges hormone called adrenalin. When excess adrenalin is discharged in the blood due to emotional responses it increases the heartbeat. These palpitations in the heartbeat take the form of high blood pressure. When faced frequently, these stress related diseases take refuge within us.</p><p>What should we do to avoid these ailments? </p><p>Protect 5 senses. </p><p>Try to stop thinking. Relax! Keep your mind empty and relaxed. </p><p>Sleep for 8 hours. </p><p>Follow correct way of spirituality (Deendari) </p><p>Absorb more and more Noor, Sakina by reciting Darood Shareef and astaghfar. </p><p>Eat simple food in small quantity. </p>
