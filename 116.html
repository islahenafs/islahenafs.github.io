                        <p>The wife is a blessing of Allah Ta‘ala till the time she fulfills her responsibilities as per the will of the husband. But, at times, due to her ignorance she may become a cause of worry to the husband. However, the wife may not realize this. That is why she does not seek forgiveness. Having struggled throughout the day at work, a husband wants to relax when he enters the comfort zone created by his wife. But, he is agonized on reaching home, as he finds his wife's behavior is inappropriate. This can result in him reacting in a harsh manner that can further cause family discord. All this leads to friction, frustration, anxiety and, inadvertently, mishaps happen in such situations. May Allah Ta’ala save all of us from this kind of agony and misery! Some people say that it is necessary to abandon all worldly pleasure to become a pious person. And we all know that a woman is one of the charms of the world. A person who compromises with his wife in an undue and unjust manner, loses his self-respect and also the respect in front of the Almighty. Allah forbid if you come across a woman of bad character and poor temperament, then pray to Allah Ta’ala for bestowing Wisdom upon you. Stay away from such women in all circumstances, as they can bring harm to you. Also, remain cautious in getting your children married, because majority of people are cheated in this matter. While getting our children married we should keep in mind the religion, family, all physical attributes, nature, wealth, education, beauty, language and culture. We must carefully find out the family's source of income and in which livelihood the boy and the girl have been brought up. Good family generation are like blood, which flows like blood in the body ,generation to generation. Basically marriages are not between girl and boys rather it is between two families, so before finalising marriages, make sure that both the family's attitude (Mizaaj) is equal. There are strong possibilities of friction if the spouses families are not compatible. The marriage is an essential part of Islam. Hence, we should take due precautions in this matter. As they say that husband and wife are like two wheels of the same vehicle called a family. Unwanted or a failed marriage is not like a piece of a furniture of the house which may be exchanged later. Marriage makes a chain of generations. Hence, selection of spouse should be done with utmost care. Doing The Istikhara (a kind of prayer where divine intervention is required from Allah Ta'ala) is suggested, must be done again and again to clear all doubts and mysteries that prevail. It is to be remembered that all the qualities described above, cannot be found in one person. Hence, religion must be preferred first (Haya, Sharam Taqwa, Taharat,Deendari, Parhez gari etc) so as the vehicle of the life may be driven peacefully. Without Deen animalistic behavior rides on human, how will you handle your spouse without Deen? Allah forbid, if your life partner is not good, then pray to Allah Ta'ala for him/her to reform. This will reward you and Allah will correct him/her. In order to reform the Nafs of a Man, Wives serve as a great hammering tool. They would say things that make no absolute sense, do things the wrong way, act in a certain way etc. But this reforms the Nafs of a Man. </p><p>The husband should remember that his wife has given him the best part of her life the youth, devotes a very large part of her life to him and family. So he should always be kind to her. In these modern times of information technology there is another menace which has cropped up. The social networking sites carry certain statements by people which are used as evidences and statements which may carry a personal grudge. We all know that these days development in information communication technology (ICT) has created new ways for everyone to interact and conduct business. There is no doubt that Internet is one of the most popular mediums of communication in cyber environment. However, this medium is also creating opportunities for people to commit various types of offences and wrong doings. The offences include divorce or talaaq. The discord between couples is aggravated to the point of “no return” and hence couples decide to part ways. It is important to understand and remember even in times of discord that the words may be deleted from your personal device but stay in the device of the recipient. Satan is happy when the marriage breaks because this way the relationship between a number of people is broken between two families. Many Muslim women have been highly influenced by Western culture so they have adopted their life style in terms of dressing, eating, educating, living according to them; not only this they are also proud of it. Now what is happening -our children are also adopting their culture, In return children are becoming disobedient, but I want to mention here divorces are becoming common these days just as these extremely common in Europe and America, even in Middle East too. The moment women give up on the path of respect and obedience towards husband, the road toward misunderstanding strengthens. Once I asked Hazrat Maulana Zubair sahib (Rehm..),” What kind of girl one should marry?” He replied in these simple words, “The girl who looks after the household, husband, children and relatives very well.” To be honest maximum chaos occurs when the girl neglects these issues, at the same time we love those girls who perform these duties sincerely. Another question I asked him how many wives one should have at a time? He replied have one, with whom you live a peaceful life. </p>
