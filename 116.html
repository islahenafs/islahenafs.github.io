                        <p>If the nature of the spouse is compatible, it is one of the greatest Blessings of Allah Ta‘ala. However, if the nature of the wife is not as per the nature and liking of the husband then life can become big misery for the entire family. Wife should understand that her husband's will should be of prime importance to her and she should not take any step against his will. Similarly the husband should also consider her suggestions. He should also keep in mind that his wife should not be displeased with his poor attitude and bad behavior. Always remember that Allah Ta‘ala has bestowed the wife in the shelter of her husband and his family. So, by no means should the husband and his family cause worry, misery or agony to the woman. For, a woman leaves her home to be accepted by your family and she should be treated and respected as other members of your family. </p>
