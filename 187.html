                        <p>The person who sacrifices his desires for Allah's Command will improve his Imaan. Allah is pleased with such people. Keep fasts in Ramzan and read Quran as much as you can with the intention that may Allah destroy my animalistic tendencies. Perform Hajj in such a way that all secrets of Imaan, Aakhirah, Quran and Sunnah are fully discovered, because Makkhah and Madinah are the highest place of spirituality in Islam to discover Hidaya and Aakhirah. A trip there must be the turning point of your life. Give Zakat to cleanse your wealth so that Allah becomes pleased. </p>
