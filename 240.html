                        <p>Do not forget to build a strong relation with Allah, you must wake up in the middle of the night for Tahajjudh, shed tears and beg Allah for your well-being in Duniya and Aakhirah because everything is in the hands of Allah and all the work will be done according to His Wishes. Save yourself from sins and forbidden things (haram), do the work of Dawaah till death, serve and respect your parents, especially your mother because she has brought you up with great difficulties. By doing this, your heart will fill with immense peace and pleasure and Allah will help you in your work. You will be happy and content. Be consistent, focused, humble and dedicated towards the above- mentioned points. </p>
