                        <p>Basic principle of any work is to keep the heart and mind clean and empty by doing Isteghfar. Then start the work by reciting Bismillah and always remain focused to the present work and follow its principle (Sunnah & Commands of Allah) which we need to practice in our day to day life, but the devil will always play game by diverting and exploiting focus and thoughts throughout our life whenever we intend to do something. </p>
