                        <p>Identify your own personal short comings and destructions and get rid of from there, for example Mr.Abdullah is suffering from stress, diabetes, high blood pressure, food cravings, tobacco addiction and laziness (ghaflat) so he has to cure these diseases otherwise destruction will strike through these path. The moment we want to do something or try to remain focused to our priorities many distraction will take place by Satan so that we don't do that work with full dedication and concentration that I have already mentioned in the book. </p>
