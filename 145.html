                        <p>Why does anyone surrender himself to a person of Allah (Allah Walah)?</p><p>The company and the grooming of our Prophet Mohammad (PBUH) molded them to such extent (that they are so highly revered) as all of them surrendered themselves to (Prophet) so unconditionally. Companions of our Prophet got rewarded with the title of Radhi Allahu Ta’ala Anhu (May Allah be pleased with them) as they got groomed in his company under his tutelage. In the same way a man surrenders himself to any Allah- Walah (pious) or to a Virtuous man so that his sins are washed off and his weaknesses are removed so that he attains near perfection. His soul gradually gets purified and his connection with Allah is established. </p><p>A farmer harvests his land and a gardener nurtures his orchards so that he can get good crop. Similarly a man becomes virtuous, Allah fearing and guided only by following an Allah- Walah. The grace and grooming of Allah- Walah let the flowers, of love and fear of Allah, bloom one's heart and the person achieves piety. This should be clear to one and all that there is nothing better (in this World) save to be in the company of Allah to seek His love. One has to connect spiritually with an Allah- Walah to establish a bond. This bond or spiritual connection will oversee his soul and protect his heart from the worldly desires. This cannot be attained without the allegiance of an Allah- Walah as only a Master is the biggest Well Wisher of his follower. An Allah- Walah will guide the person in every walk of life. Following an Allah- Walah will solidify one's belief in Allah and his heart and deeds will always be attentive to the will of Allah. The follower would be able to keep himself clean from the smaller and bigger sins of life in public and private. An Allah- Walah is instrumental for creating the love between his followers and Allah. Allah says about Prophet Moses in Quran, “I have bestowed thee with great love. Whosoever would glance upon you would love me.” Indeed you cannot expect good crop without rains/ watering your fields. You can also not expect the divine love without the intercession of an Allah- Wala. This is a divine system that Allah made Doctors and medicines to cure your physical afflictions and diseases. On the same lines he made Allah- Wala to cure and purify your souls from desires and afflictions. These Allah- Wala help people to connect spiritually with Allah and help them to get ready for Aakhirah, the final destination. It's advisable to ensure that you take your children to pious and scholarly persons (Buzurg). These children would benefit immensely in their company and it would be extremely beneficial for their Duniya and Aakhirah. Their divine light (Noor), Wisdom and guidance serve as a source of betterment. How to identify a real Allah wala (he's an emerald if he is one)? First of all you will see his heart is completely devoted towards Aakhirah, the present world amounts to nothing in front of him, his life revolves around Taqwa (Piety), Sunnah, Sharia and the Commands of Allah. He will never plead for help that is material in nature, even when his needs are extreme. He will guide and advice you to follow the Sunnah and Sharia at all times. Finally his only wish is to help you in all your worldly and Hereafter affairs whenever you seek advice from him, so that you are inclined towards Deen and spirituality. These are qualities you will find in pious and devout people; when you do, hold them firmly and follow their advice strictly. However all medical and legal advice should be taken from doctors and lawyers. Before surrendering yourself to an Allah-wala you must judge him through a multi dimensional approach because exploitation and deception are common these days. If encountered with the wrong ones, you are sure to be sucked out of money energy and capacity. To avoid repentance later, be sure of them. </p><p>"Whoever takes a Wali of Mine as an Enemy ..." Abu Huraira (radiyallahu anhu) narrated that the Messenger of Allah (sallallahu alaihe wa-sallam) said: “Allah, the Exalted said... “Whoever takes a Wali of Mine an enemy, I will wage war on him;and My slave will not perform any act with which he draws closer to Me, more beloved to Me then when he fulfills what I have ordained on him;and My salve will keep drawing closer to Me by performing the Nawafil (voluntary acts of worship) until I love him,and when I love him, I will be his hearing with which he hears, his sight with which he sees, his hands with which he strikes, and his legs with which he walks;and if he asks Me, I will give him; and if he seeks refuge with Me, I will grant him refuge”.
