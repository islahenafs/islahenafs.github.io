                        <p>The habits biologically caused by Neuro-pathways develop in childhood and the child becomes a slave of those pathways (habits) throughout his life. Parents are responsible for the good education and morals of children. Do not do wrong activities in front of children because, though they may not speak, but they will see and notice. Two habits must be developed in the path of Allah. First, to worship Allah and second, doing the deeds which pleases Allah. The problem is that these habits are not developed and, majorly, it is because of social media applications such as WhatsApp, Facebook, etc, that minds are wavering. </p>
