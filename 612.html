                        <p>The strength (Imaan) to carry out certain activities (Commands of Allah) and the importance of principles (Sunnah and Taqwa) that restrict one from wrong doings (Haram) is termed as a Blinkers On. Remain completely focused to the subject you are presently dealing with. What happens during performance, ‘focus’ tries to divert towards non priority subject and mind starts wondering, leaving behind the present work and priority. It is the non-priority subject which creates hindrance towards your priority. If your focus and thoughts are exploited your capacity and capabilities are automatically destroyed. Also control the heart when it starts advancing towards wastage of time, darkness & hypocrisy (Gumrahi & Nifaq) </p>
