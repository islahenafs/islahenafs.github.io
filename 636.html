                        <p>Train your Nafs in such a way, so that it does not influence you with negative and wrong thoughts. Whatever work you do, the same thoughts develop in the mind, that is why from time to time it is important to clean the mind from all junk thoughts of the materials, these are only possible if we focus towards, Imaan, Yaqeen, Fear of Allah, Zikr of Allah, Dua andAstaghfar. Throughout your life you should think yourselves as a sinner and try to shed tears in front of Allah for your sins committed. By doing this, Insha- Allah, heart will be soft and kind. It is very important to learn how to switch on and off between several activities. Always maintain self respect and dignity in front of others. Be cautious about talks and action because Allah's hidden decision reflects in the life according to our activities and performance whether good or bad. </p>
