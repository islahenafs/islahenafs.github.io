                        <p>There lies a blank space within the hearts of children. The parents, who fill up this blank space by their love and restrain the fondness for other unwanted things from entering into the hearts of their children, are blessed. There is an old saying that children go where they get immense pleasure and stay where they get love and affection. So, do not let your children get spoiled. Restrain them from bad company as well as bad habits, extravagance, watching TV for long hours, surfing the Internet on computer or on mobile phone or downloading filthy videos or songs on the ipod. Since it is not possible for children to not use the computer these days or possess a mobile phone, they must be permitted to avail these things for a certain times and prescribed hours. Many people are so occupied in their own worldly chores and religious activities that they forget to take care of their children and repent later, when the children become wayward. This is a common phenomenon these days. </p>
