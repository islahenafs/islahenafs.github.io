                        <h2>31</h2><h3>ISLAHE NAFS (REFORM YOUR SELF)</h3><a href='https://darulqulub.com/about-author/'><h3 style='color: #00ff41;'>by Dr. Mohsin Ali</h3></a>
                        
                        <p>I want to draw your attention to an important aspect of Islam, which is humanity and the real compassion of the heart, which was given by Allah Ta'ala to the Prophet (PBUH) and his pious Companions. Nowadays, this compassion is vanishing from our hearts. Whenever Prophet (PBUH) would see a mother loving her child, his heart would melt at the sight. Whenever he would see an animal in distress or a man suffering from an ailment, he would be grieved. Once, seeing the pathetic conditions of Hazrat Mus'ab bin Umair (RA), who used to be a prince, Prophet (PBUH) felt a lot of grief and he wept, seeing his suffering. Similarly, whenever Hazrat Usman (RA), one of the companions of Prophet (PBUH), passed by a graveyard, he would weep to such an extent that his beard would get wet. When strong winds or storms occurred, the facial expressions of Prophet (PBUH) would change. He would start fearing Allah even more, and would pray for the peace and wellbeing of the Ummah. But today, our condition is such that even after listening to the tragic incidents of Taif, our heart is not affected. Even the problems and sufferings of loved ones such as parents and children do not affect our heart. Even after listening to entire Quran during the Salaah of Taraweeh in Ramzan, a single drop of tear does not fall from our eyes. We don't know what has happened to our hearts. Most of us have already lived a major part of our lives, but do not acknowledge the proximity of death nor are we preparing for it. All hearts are controlled by Allah SWT. If He is pleased with our good deeds, He will certainly gift us with the Noor of Imaan and Enlightenment (Hidayah). </p>
