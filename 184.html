                        <p>Intellect and education may have developed more but not Wisdom. Knowledge is useless without a heightened Wisdom. A computer software has all the instructions on how to douse a fire, but can it actually do it when a fire breaks? No. Someone has to step up and carry out the act. A thing about Intellect: lets combine the entire worlds intellect as 100 percent in totality, out of which Allah has given 99% of it to Prophet Mohammad PBUH and the remaining 1% to all scientists, reachers, engineers and doctors etc. Is it not self explanatory on how intelligent is our beloved Prophet PBUH. His ways are ones filled with intellect & wisdom. </p>
