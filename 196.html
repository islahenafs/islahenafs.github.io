                        <p>If a man does not give up his desires and does not carry out his responsibilities, he will not benefit from any of these pointers. The Prophet (PBUH) bore the responsibility of the entire World and Hereafter, yet he took care of the minutest needs of his family. One day, he went to the house of his daughter Hazrat Fatima (R.A.) and asked her as what was the reason that she went to the house of the Prophet the other day. However today, we consider ourselves great by practicing even little amount of religion. We do not take care of our parents or children. We do not bother about the moral values of our children. We are devoted solely to an odd job. It's time we realize all these. </p>
