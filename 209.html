                        <p>Decide the terms and conditions of transactions and dealings in advance so that no misunderstandings occur later on. Otherwise be ready to face all kinds of chaos. For example: If you have decided ona certain amount as a labours’ wage, ensure that the payment given to the person is accurate. Your dealings must remain as it would be with strangers. Count the money yourself and make a written note of it. Do not just trust your mental faculties. Check if the person who is given a loan has bandwidth to repay it otherwise, relations can be jeopardized. No one should act upon anything without realizing as what can be the possible outcomes of this action. If you do this then you would turn out to be a fool. Do not start a business ventures with the loans. Sadly, Allah does not help in such businesses. Loan causes humiliation in the day and restlessness at night. The Prophet PBUH said, “Whoever knocks the door of the people for his necessities, Allah will close the door on him.” Asking others for favours causes humiliation but refusing it grants you respect. </p>
