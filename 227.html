                        <p>Worship makes rewards available to us. However they are subjected to change at the time of sickness. The reward for taking care of your loved ones during their sickness will be equal to the amount of time spent worshiping. Whatever rewards you are to receive through worshiping will be rewarded if you attend and take care of a sick person. </p>
