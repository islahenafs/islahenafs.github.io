                        <p>I have observed that many people practice religion steadfastly but they are not good in the public dealing. Whereas on the other hand many people are very good in social interaction but are not good enough in sacrificing their desires. Few people are good in sacrificing their worldly desires. However they do not fulfil others rights and own responsibilities. One who is good in all aspects is deemed wise. </p>
