                        <p>By the Grace of Allah, I have completed this book and you have taken time to go through the same. Neither you nor I may have all these virtues in us but we need to practice hard and implement the knowledge into action. You need to spend time in the company of scholars and religious people only then you get knowledge. Putting your knowledge into practice is an ultimate practice. </p>
