                        <p>Unnecessarily talking to people, meeting with people with a negative outlook and thereby neglecting priorities. My mother once said “Son ! Stop over thinking there is Allah above your head to take care of you. In life it is true that we have to fulfill some of our allowed (halal) desires (Nafsani Khawhish) but while doing so, do not cross the red line, also know your limitations. If you commit any mistake in performance you will have to suffer. If you violate Allah's Commands, forget to follow the Sunnah of Prophet SWS and suppress other’s rights then consequences will follow. Warning: Never chase the world and it's people, do not get impressed by the materialistic world and act. Detachment too is an art that needs deliberate practice. “The state of your life is nothing but a reflection of your body, heart, mind and soul.”</p>
