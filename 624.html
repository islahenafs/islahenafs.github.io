                        <p>Think correctly, control your thoughts and sometimes ignore them too, for the wrongs result in incorrect decisions multiply your problems. One must wonder whether Allah's divine kingdom is against me that is why I am facing problems such as obstruction, eventuality, poverty, ailment and losses. What management says, “State the problem and find the solution”. We don't see Satan but his plans are dreadful. </p>
