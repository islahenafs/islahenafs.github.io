                        <p>How to take advantage of the Mind?) [TRFA Protect it from all non-priorities that its focused upon. Protect the senses in such a way that nobody can exhaust your mind. All your Resources must be used to excel in your own priorities. And protect it from all kinds of destructions. Empty the heart and mind. Decide your priorities and work on them one after another. Grip tight the rein of your thoughts and focus while working on priorities so that the do not interfere or divert it elsewhere. My own priorities are Worshiping, work of Dawah, present sufferings, health, profession, family, relationship and the Hereafter. Inevitably Nafs will take my focus towards non priorities such as social media sites.</p>
