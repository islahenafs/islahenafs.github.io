                        <p>I notice how family members are becoming damage due to the constant involvement with gadgets like computers and smartphone. Social media apps viz. Twitter, WhatsApp and Facebook are eating into family time. Everybody is busy surfing and chatting. Husbands, wives and children all are busy interacting with people who are distant but are distancing amongst them. There are times when no body is interacting with any body. As a result, cordial relations are getting irrevocably damaged. </p>
