                        <p>My book mentions those time-tested techniques and details the importance of an Allah-walah. Another case in point, it has been duty noted that some of the followers of Khangah do not give much importance to the workers of Dawaah, and are of the view that these people are just wasting their valuable time and money without much gain. I think they are over-looking how often the Quran and Hadees mention the very importance of the path of Allaah and its consequences upon its neglect. As clich√©d it may read but this Deen surfaced and made its way to us because of that very struggle and strife. Today you can see its success and scale on how Farz, Wajibat and Sunnah have survived again which at one point almost disappeared from many parts of the world. Not only this but the number of people who have given up their past life and rooted out their evils, repented and adopted a righteous path, do we not see that? </p>
