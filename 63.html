                        <p>Some people who have spent a little time in the path of Allah make them develop a superiority complex towards Ulemas and Scholars. The way they talk and do Taskeel - its so evident. This I condemn and strongly oppose to as something that's perpetuating wrong action. In order to rectify and reform Nafs and turn one towards becoming pious and obedient to Allah, many Sheikhs have crafted a beautiful technique to reform Nafs. </p>
