                        <p>Ask yourself and your children whether they just dream or do something like the Companions of the Prophet (peace be upon him), called Sahabah. Dreamers pass life just thinking. I often suggest to my children these things: remember Allah in silence and calmness, remain focused towards duties and responsibilities, then perform them through Sunnah; this way neither are neglected, practice self control, so that you don't commit any evil. This world is a place of deception, displeasures and filled with Satan's trap so have knowledge and patience to counter them. (<a href = 'https://quran.com/ali-imran/185'>Quran 3:185, Sura Ali-Imran</a>)</p><p>Surah Ali-Imran states 'the life of this world is no more than the delusion of enjoyment.'</p>
