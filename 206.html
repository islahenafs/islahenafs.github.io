                        <p>If you are benefitting from some person but some of his flaws hurt you, do not break links with him, instead carry on the relationship and enjoy the benefits you are getting. If you break this relationship even the little benefits will not come your way. Never break a true relation for few faults nobody is perfect, nobody is correct in the end. Affection is always greater than perfection. </p>
