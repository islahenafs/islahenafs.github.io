                        <p>There are many negative forces which are hidden within our body such as prohibited (Haram) desires, useless things, mere words, the lust for power and wealth, any kind of evil and prohibited luxury, (Haram women, food etc.) these things should not destroy the light of our Imaan and priority. Otherwise our present sufferings will multiply. The meaning of Deen is to prepare for the Day of Judgment and show less interest in materialistic goods. The lust for worldly desires makes us incapable to collect good deeds (Aamaal) for Hereafter. </p>
