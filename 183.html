                        <p>There are lots of people who desire to practice silence but are not able to. They are compulsive chatterboxes and it's difficult for them to practice silence. Any adverse situation makes them talk excessively. Practice silence, it's the only way to maintain a quiet composure. When you develop the ability to listen to negative comments without losing your temper or confidence it means you have become mature and truly intellectual. </p>
