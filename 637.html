                        <p>Remember Allah in complete silence and calmness. Be present (Labbaik). The Heart has its own pair of eyes, use one eye towards the Zikr of Allah that listen to recites Zikr of Allah with full devotion. The other eye should guard the mind from retrieving past memories and entering your thoughts to divert the focus towards materialistic world and its people. Insha-Allah if you recite or listen to Zikr of Allah through this technique you will achieve lots of Noor, Sakina, Imaan, Barakah and peace. In day-to-day life, practice the same principle for instance while eating, one eye should remain focused towards Sunnah and other should guide the mind. </p>
