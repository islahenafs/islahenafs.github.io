                        <p>If you are kind and merciful towards Allah's Creations, certainly He will send His enormous Blessing. Develop self control - just the way a jockey rides his horse with his rein and whip. If we train ourselves in this way, our desires (animalistic tendencies) will be disappeared and loyalty towards Allah and his Prophet will be achieved. </p>
