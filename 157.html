                        <p>Don't try to act superior all the time. Don't think that you are right and others are wrong. May be you are wrong and the others are right. Try your best to not let anything negative cloud your mind because what is hidden in the heart starts reflecting through the body and tongue and at times you won't even be aware of it. </p>
