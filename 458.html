                        <p>Why ls It that ailments, obstructions and displeasures surround us? The beginnings are usually with bitterness and adversity. All of Allah's actions are hidden with Wisdom and knowledge. Allah (SWT) wants us to be free of our addictions in our Mind, to reduce ignorance, prohibit us from certain things (Haram or not suitable), to develop the experience, to do reform (Tarbiyat), to reflect on our wrong doings and short comings, to be focused towards repentance (Tauba), to teach patience, faith (Imaan) & belief (Yaqeen), to put to Test, to remind fate (Taqdeer), to develop self-control, to fulfill the Commands of Allah and to show us the right path enlightenment (Hidayah). All, so we remain focused towards Allah and His religion (Deen). </p>
