                        <p>Enlightenment and guidance are hidden for those who strive on the path of Allah for the cause of Dawaah. The importance of Dawaah is by virtue of this only. It has been proven that Allah's Help and Blessings are hidden by performing the work of Dawaah. This is the duty of every common person so the help is also common. The six points of Dawaah itself are so important and vast that no one could write or explain completely. All the messengers of Allah were sent to this world with good qualities and characteristics, but we individuals have to develop those characteristics and qualities by striving hard in the path of Allah (Dawaah). Work of Dawaah brings a very special kind of peace and tranquility in the heart and mind which normally does not come through any other work of Deen. Those who neglect to perform this work with consistence often face various hindrances to their daily life such as poverty, obstruction and scarcity (Be-Barkati) etc. This is a proven fact. </p>
