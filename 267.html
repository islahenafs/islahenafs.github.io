                        <p>May Allah save us from being dependent upon others. So being independent should become a habit. There is no relief compared to the one you get upon carrying any difficult job on your own. Repeatedly taking favours from others can cultivate into a bad habit. The Prophet (PBUH) used to carry out all activities with his own hands. I have witnessed the pious picking up the spittoon themselves, instead of waiting for someone else's help to do so. </p>
