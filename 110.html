                        <p>Do not keep your children and spouse away from yourself or keep them unaware of the knowledge of Deen. Always teach them to be pious and religious just as you are supposed to be. Pray for them too. Try to make them a performers, a master strategists and efficient performers within the boundaries of Deen of Islam. If they remain ignorant of good deeds they will indulge in wrongful acts and on the day of the judgment they will hold you responsible. In this process you will also invite Allah Taâ€™ala's wrath. </p>
