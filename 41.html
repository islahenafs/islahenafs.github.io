                        <p>Adamant and arrogant people do not realize their mistakes and it is impossible to convince them. They think they are right, but it is vital for them understand that they may be wrong, while others may be are right. If we remain ignorant and arrogant, we will suffer even more. Anybody who thinks and acts against the Quran and Sunnah will see peace disappear from his/her heart. Those who desire to eat unhealthy food all the time will see their health to be deteriorated. An interesting thing about the purified human spiritual heart is that it (the heart) will accept only which mention an the Quran and the way of life of Prophet (PBUH) Sunnah. He (PBUH) and his pious Companions (RA) have left a particular way of life which is fully compatible with the intricacies of the human heart. This means, if we do not follow these principles and choose a different path, our heart will not accept it and we will become restless and hence suffer in life. </p>
