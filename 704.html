                        <p>Spirituality is the sources of all moral standards. It gives man the power to forgive the offender. It raises him above greed, the feeling of envy is uprooted. The spiritual person treats people with tolerance. He honours people without any discrimination. He refrains from committing injustice, always adhering to the path of justice. He treats even his enemies with justice and fairness. in society, he becomes a giver rather than just a taker. </p>
