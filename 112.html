                        <p>If a child obeys his parents and teachers and serves willingly and obediently, he will attain good heights in life and Hereafter by way of their blessings and prayers. The blessings and prayers of parents and teachers are very beneficial and important for success in life. But, most children do not understand this. They neither respect their parents, nor teachers and therefore go through sufferings in life. After Allah and Prophet (PBUH) the most important gift of this world is the patents, earn their Dua and love as much as you can, you are fortunate if you are having both of them. Ask those who have lost them. Be obedient to them, serve them as your priorities, and treat their commands as Allah's Commands. Hell and Heaven lies at their feet. Never act against their wishes. “My Lord! Bestow on them thy Mercy even as they cherished me in childhood” Al Quran. </p>
