                        <p>A friend of my wife once rightly mentioned that we must keep our children in a competitive and healthy environment - an environment where their capabilities can be utilized to the optimum level and they are encouraged to achieve greater heights in life. Otherwise, their capabilities will be trapped in negative things and they will suffer losses and failure in life. </p>
