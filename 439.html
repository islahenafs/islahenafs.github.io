                        <p>It has been also noticed that some people develop some bad habits from the path of Allah such as eating too much, sleeping more often, talking too much and become careless about family, health, children. They think everything is in hands of Allah so what can you do. It's simply wrong. Allah has given us responsibilities to fulfill others rights. If we behave like this others will take bad lesson from us. Time to time the Ameer sahib must explain these subjects. </p>
