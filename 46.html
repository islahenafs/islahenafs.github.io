                        <p>It is a Blessing of Allah to have knowledge of Quran and Hadith (sayings of the Prophet PBUH). But at the same time, it is not easy to act in accordance with them. It is advisable not to seek too much information but seek right and relevant knowledge suitable for your daily life. We spend so much time on Social Media like WhatsApp, Facebook and Twitter in exchanging tons of information, jokes, ahadith etc. How much of that is implemented in our day to day life? It is better to perform righteous deeds one after one, quietly. The results are bound to happen. There was a time when people suffered due to ignorance and insufficient knowledge; this is reversed now with the explosion of information. People are now suffering because of their attempts to amass excess amounts of irrelevant knowledge. Buckets of Knowledge can never be completely filled, which provokes further accumulation. People miss out on their priorities in their pursuit of unnecessary knowledge. This is causing undue wastage of time and energy and has become a habit. In this age watching, reading or listening to information is becoming increasingly interesting and addictive, fuelling the thirst for more informationâ€”thus our priorities are neglected and often left incomplete. Priorities serve as the base of one's actions, so when they are undervalued, our sufferings take on a new shape. Knowledge without practice and implementation is useless. The best in the world have very high level of execution intelligence they get things done fast. Work hard in silence, let success make the noise. </p>
