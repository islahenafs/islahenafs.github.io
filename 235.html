                        <p>Human desires are the greatest enemy towards paying obedience to Prophet Mohammad (PBUH). Prophetic Sunnah are disappearing from the world because of worldly desires. Once Prophet (PBUH) said, “A man cannot become a Momin (believer) until and unless his every desire is fully in accordance with the religion which I have brought (the religion of Islam)”. Millions of desires and wishes emerge from the heart but whosoever runs after them and tries to fulfill all of them will be destroyed. That's because addiction to pleasures will keep enhancing in the mind. It's because of this, Allah and Prophet PBUH have prohibited us from fulfilling desires that are haraam. </p>
